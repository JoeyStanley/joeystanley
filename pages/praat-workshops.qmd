# Praat Workshops

Lisa Lipani and I will be hosting a series of four workshops on Praat and Praat scripting during Fall 2019. This page will house the handouts and all materials for those workshops.

Note: All workshops will be held at 3:35pm at the DigiLab (300 Main Library) 

<br/>

## [*Praat Basics: Introduction to the software*](/downloads/190911-intro_to_Praat)

*September 11, 2019*---In this workshop, I'll introduce the software Praat, and will how how to install the software, record audio, save audio, extract some acoustic measurements by hand, and do a manual transcription. It will also briefly discuss the important steps you need to take to prep your data *before* using Praat. (For former students of mine, this workshop will overlap with [this homework assignment](/downloads/190523-Praat_tutorial.pdf).)

<br/>

## [*Praat Scripting Basics: Loops, I/O, and TextGrids*](/downloads/190918-praat_scripting)

*September 18, 2019*---With some basic understanding of the software, Lisa will lead the workshop on the fundamentals of Praat scripting: object management, looping through a TextGrid, and how to get your data in and out of a Praat script.

<br/>

## [*Automatic Formant Extraction in Praat*](/downloads/191002-formant_extraction) (and [supplement](/downloads/191001-formant_extraction_supplement))

*October 2, 2019*---In this workshop, you'll learn, from start to finish, how to write a Praat script that will automatically extract formant measurements and a other acoustic measurements from your audio and transcription. There will be quite a bit of overlap with [this blog post](/blog/a-tutorial-on-extracting-formants-in-praat), only you will get more detail with an in-person guide.
