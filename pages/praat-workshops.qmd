## [*Praat Basics: Introduction to the software*](/downloads/190911-intro_to_Praat.html)

This tutorial introduces the software. It covers how how to install the software, record audio, save audio, extract some acoustic measurements by hand, and do a manual transcription. It will also briefly discuss the important steps you need to take to prep your data *before* using Praat. (For former students of mine, this workshop will overlap with [this homework assignment](/downloads/190523-Praat_tutorial.pdf).)

## [*Praat Scripting Basics: Loops, I/O, and TextGrids*](/downloads/190918-praat_scripting.html)

This tutorial covers the fundamentals of Praat scripting: object management, looping through a TextGrid, and how to get your data in and out of a Praat script. This tutorial assumes some basic understanding of how Praat works and builds off the previous tutorial.

## [*Automatic Formant Extraction in Praat*](/downloads/191002-formant_extraction.html) (and [supplement](/downloads/191001-formant_extraction_supplement.html))

In this workshop, you'll learn, from start to finish, how to write a Praat script that will automatically extract formant measurements and a other acoustic measurements from your audio and transcription. There will be quite a bit of overlap with [this blog post](/blog/a-tutorial-on-extracting-formants-in-praat).
