Here is a never-complete but growing description of my idiolect. I'll add to it whenever I think of or discover new things about the way I speak English.

## Overview

I don't like it when people say they don't have an accent, however, my pronunciation is pretty close to what I'd call standard American English. I grew up in St. Charles County, Missouri, which is a suburb of St. Louis. You can read [Matt Gordon](https://english.missouri.edu/people/gordon) and [Chris Strelluf](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/al/people/strelluf/)'s work for an in-depth analysis of Missouri English. See also [Dan Duncan](https://sites.google.com/view/dan-duncan-sociolinguist/)'s research which is focuses specifically on St. Charles County for an even closer match to my speech. My mom grew up in Minnesota and my dad grew up in Upstate New York and Minnesota.

## Vowels

Here is a general look at my monophthongs. These come from a recording of me reading a bunch of real and nonce words where the vowel is flanked by coronals. (You can access this dataset with my [joeysvowels](https://joeystanley.github.io/joeysvowels/) package.)

As far as I can tell, I don't have really any indication of any of the chain shifts that a lot of sociolinguisys are studying. Even though I grew up in the St. Louis Corridor, I don't have the Northern Cities Shift. I also don't have the Low-Back-Merger or the Low-Back-Merger Shift.

### My low back vowels

My <sc>lot</sc> and <sc>thought</sc> vowels are rather close phonetically but are definitely not merged. <sc>Lot</sc> is slightly fronter and unrounded while <sc>thought</sc> is slightly backer and rounded. They are very close to what Jonathan Dowse transcribes as \[ɐ̞\] and \[ɒ̈\] [here](https://jbdowse.com/ipa/).

You can read a fairly comprehensive list of words that I classify as <sc>lot</sc> and <sc>thought</sc> in Appendix C (pg. 209) of my [dissertation](/downloads/200417-dissertation-revised.pdf), reproduced in a blog post [here](/blog/my-cot-caught-distribution). On page 161, I explain that I have a clear intuition about which words are classified into which lexical set, though admittedly a few like *probably*, *prom*, *mom*, *bronco*, and *pond* could go either way.

Like a lot of Americans even with the distinction, *dog* is <sc>thought</sc>, as are many other pre-/ɡ/ words. However, there are a few exceptions, like *cog*, which has an especially fronted vowel quality. Also, the name *Og*, as in the author Og Mandino, which is short for *Augustine*, bothers me because *Og* is clearly <sc>lot</sc> while *Augustine* is <sc>thought</sc>.

Prelaterally, I have a conditioned merger, which is best described in [Aaron Dinkin's (2016) JEngL paper](https://doi.org/10.1177/0075424216634795). [Aaron's paper is based in Upstate New York, close to where my dad is from and I have confirmed that my dad has this too. It's very possible that I got this from him. But then again, attestation in New York does not mean it's *not* attested elsewhere. It very well could be more widespread. I'd have to test kids I went to school with to see if they also have it.]{.aside} I have <sc>lot</sc> if the vowel is in an open syllable (and the following lateral is the onset of the following syllable), as in *collar*, *dollar*, *anthropology*, *ollie*, and *trolley*. In fact, I have a rather fronted vowel, fronter than my <sc>lot</sc> normally is. However, I have <sc>thought</sc> if the lateral is tautosyllabic, as in *golf*, *dolphin*, *volume*, and *doll*. Thus, words like *doll* & *hall* rhyme, while *hollar* & *hauler* and *collar* & *caller* do not. You can hear me pronounce these words in the video in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/joey_stan/status/1440022805039353856?s=20&t=RLBVBLgh7rnp0TMTUqnObg).

As is typical of American English, the <sc>cloth</sc> lexical set is indistinguishable from my <sc>thought</sc>. Similarly, the <sc>palm</sc> set (and any "Foreign *a*" words; [Boberg 2009](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954394509990172)) mostly fits in with my <sc>lot</sc>. Except, ironically, *palm* itself (as well as *psalm*, *qualm*, and *alms*), because of that /l/, which makes it part of <sc>thought</sc>.

One important phonological distinction between my <sc>lot</sc> and <sc>thought</sc> is that, even though [Hayes (2009:82)](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Introductory+Phonology-p-9781405184113) says tenseness is not specified for low vowels, <sc>lot</sc> appears to be a lax vowel. Like other lax vowels, it doesn't appear word-finally, except in marginal cases like *ma* and *pa*, onomatopoeia (*fa-la-la-la-la*, *haha*, *blah*), and interjections (*aha!*, *hurrah!*). This means that some <sc>palm</sc> words like *bra* are reclassifed as <sc>thought</sc>. There are some exceptions though, like *spa* and *schwa*. So yes, for me, *spa* /spɑ/ and *bra* /bɹɔ/ don't rhyme.

### My <sc>CURE</sc> lexical set

Like probably most Americans, my <sc>cure</sc> is all over the place. Here is how I pronounce the words listed  [here](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/24-cure-lexical-set/#:~:text=The%20cure%20lexical%20set%20features,with%20or%20without%20r%2Dcoloring.) and [here](https://www.yorku.ca/earmstro/courses/phonetics/lexical_sets.pdf): 

* [ɔɹ] (so merged with <sc>force</sc>/<sc>north</sc>): *amour*, *bourgeois*, *Bourne*, *gourd*, *gourmet*, *moor*, *mourn* (-ing, -er, -ful, -ed), *paramour*, *parkour*, *poor*, *your* (when stressed)

* [uɹ]: *allure*, *boorish*, *contour*, *detour*, *endure* (citation form), *Fleur*, *lure*, *manure*, *McClure*, *pleura*, *tour* (-ism, -ing)

* [ɚ] (so, merged with <sc>nurse</sc>): *adjure*, *assure*, *bourbon*, *caricature*, *centurion*, *cesura*, *courier*, *during*, *embouchure*, *endure* (non-citation form), *ensure*, *futurity*, *Honduras*, *insure*, *jury*, *jurisdiction*, *luxurious*, *mature*, *Missouri*, *neural*, *neuron*, *plural*, *rural*, *spurious*, *sure*, *tournament*, *tourniquet*, *Ventura*

* [jɚ] (<sc>nurse</sc> with a jod): *bureau*, *cure*, *curious*, *curate*, *demure*, *Euro*, *Europe*, *fury* (-ious), *Huron*, *injure*, *injurious*, *manicure*, *mural*, *Muriel*, *obscure* (-ity), *pedicure*, *procure*, *pure* (-ify, -ity), *Puritan*, *secure*, *security*, *sulfuric*, *Ural*, *Uri*, *urine*, *Uruguay*

And here are words that I saw going through lists of <sc>cure</sc> words that I'm completely unfamiliar with or that I have never said outloud, so I don't really know what I do: *boor*, *Bourdain*, *bourrée*, *bourse*, *Boursin*, *bravura*, *burette*, *Chambourcy*, *coiffure*, *commissure*, *Courbet*, *Courvoisier*, *craquelure*, *cynosure*, *dasyure*, *dour*, *dourine*, *Douro*, *epicure*, *gourmand*, *houri*, *immure*, *inure*, *Jourdain*, *lurid*, *Muir*, *ouroˈboroi*, *penurious*, *photogravure*, *pourparler*, *rotogravure*, *sourdine*, *spoor*, *tambour*, *tandoori*, *tellurium*, *thurible*, *tourmaline*, *tournedos*, *Truro*


### /æ/ and /ɛ/ before nasals

I raise /æ/ before nasals. Before /n/ and /m/, it's raised, fronted, and nasalized, such that *ban* is definitely not the same as *bat* or even *bad*. Before /ŋ/, it's raised even higher to the point that naive me would classify the vowel in *bang* as /e/. In fact, I'm not actually 100% convinced that it even is /æ/ underlyingly; I may have rephonologized it as being truly /e/.

As I point out on [page 74 of my dissertation](/downloads/200417-dissertation-revised.pdf), there are very few words with /ɛŋ/. A nearly complete list, as far as I know, is *length*, *lengthen*, *strength*, *strengthen*, *penguin*, *dengue*, and *Bengal (tiger)*. For what it's worth, those vowels are the same as /æŋ/, so that *bang* and the first syllable of *Bengal* are the same for me.

### *beg*-raising

As I explain on page 400 of [my 2022 *American Speech* paper on prevelar raising](http://doi.org/10.1215/00031283-9308384), I raise historic (or perhaps underlying) /ɛɡ/ to something like \[eɪɡ\] such that *beg*, *egg*, *leg*, and *Greg* all rhyme with *vague*. It happens in open syllables like in *legacy*, *negative*, and *megaphone*. It occurs in some infrequent words like *renege*. I've also got it when the vowel has secondary stress, like in *Winnipeg*, *stegosaurus*, and *nutmeg*.

However, there are a handful of exceptions, which was a major part of the reason why I did that paper in the first place. For an unclear reason to me, *integrity*, *segregate*, *interregnum*, and *segment* all have \[ɛ\]. I noticed that the /ɡ/ in those words are all followed by sonorants, but that's not a guarantee blocker of raising since *regulate*, *pregnant*, and *segue* are raised. Interestingly, *negligible* is raised but *negligent* is not. Also, *peg* is raised but *JPEG* is not. Finally, any word with \<x\> pronounced as \[ɡz\] (yes, it's voiced for me) like *exit*, *exile*, *excerpt*, and *exigence* are firmly \[ɛ\] and not \[e\].

### Rosa's Roses

I don't know the technical term for this, but I have two, possibly three, unstressed vowels, such that *Rosa's* and *roses* aren't homophonous to me. The first has \[ə\] while the second is what I'd transcribe as \[ɨ\].

My \[ɨ\] category of words is rather large and I have it in a handful of environments. Some of the distribution is predictable. I have \[ɨ\] in plurals (*classes*, *offices*), 3rd person singular (*loses*, *pushes*), and past tense allomorphs (*waited*, *decided*). Word-finally, it's always \[ə\], as in *extra*, *area*, and *data*.

In a lot of words, I think I'm influenced by spelling. Word-initially, if it's spelled with an \<a\>, \<o\>, \<u\> I have \[ə\], as in *again*, *among*, and *ago*, in *occur*, *opinion*, and *obtain*, and in *upon*, *unless*, *until*. (This spelling preference might explain why I always have \[ə\] word-finally because as far as I can tell \<a\> is the only letter used for unstressed word-final vowels.) However, if it's an \<e\>, then I have \[ɨ\], as in *expect*, *edition*, *effect*, *emotion*, *event*, and *exactly*.

Word-internally though, I haven't done enough digging to see if there are any patterns and I'm not familiar with the literature so I don't know what to look out for. I have a suspicion that if it's next to a coronal sound, the vowel is \[ɨ\] and \[ə\] otherwise. So I have \[ɨ\] in *student*, *woman*, and *happen* but \[ə\] in *problem*, *system*, and *item*. I have \[ɨ\] in *minute*, *private*, and *unit*, but \[ə\] in *product*, *democrat*, *develop*, and *proposal*. Interestingly, I have both vowels in *advocate* \[ˈædvəkɨt\]. But there are exceptions to these generalizations, like *stomach*, *perfect*, *galaxy*, *miracle*, and *obstacle* all have \[ɨ\]. I have \[ɨ\] in *regime* but \[ə\] in *machine*, which makes me think spelling is a stronger factor than phonological context. Without being too exhaustive, I'm inclined to think that \[ɨ\] is the elsewhere allophone and that \[ə\] is the exception.

As for a possible third one, I have some \[ʊ\]-like vowel in words like *success*, *support*, and *suggest*. It seems like word-initial \<su\> might be the environment, but I also get it in *to*. I'll have to dig a little deeper to think of other examples.

### Prelaterals

I have lost the ability to intuit what's going on with my back vowels before laterals, but I'll explain what I think I have. I know I merge /ʊl/ with /ol/, so that *pull* and *pole* are homophonous. However, it's the /ʌl/ class that is really tricky for me. When it's in a closed syllable, like in *hull*, *dull*, *cull*, and *mulch*, I'm pretty sure I at least *had* it merged with /ol/. However, I've looked at the list of words so much and I've thought about this enough that I pretty much know all the words that fall into this category without thinking (at least the one-syllable words) and I apparently want to unmerge them, so now you'll be hard pressed to find me saying *hull* the same as *hole*, even in casual situations. Words like *culture*, *result*, *vulnerable*, *multuple*, and *ultimately*, I have no idea what I do.

In fact, it was this homophone that got me interested in prelaterals in the first place! There is a small town near the University of Georgia named *Hull*, and I had to go there for something. I thought to myself over and over as a I drove there, "Wait, is this pronounced like *Hole*?" I never did really figure out what I did.

However, when it's in an open syllable, like *color*, *gullet*, and *sculley*, it's [ʌ]. The word *adult* fits in this category as being firmly \[ʌ\] rather than \[o\]. Though not all open syllable words are \[ʌ\] because like *gully* and *mulligan* I think I said as \[o\] when I was younger. (Not sure what I do now.) A word like *sullen* could go either way, even now.

## Some of my favorite quirks

Here are a list of some of my favorite things I have in my idiolect.

-   I epenthesize a \[k\] in <i>ancient</i>, \[ẽɪ̃ŋkʃɨnt\]. I think what's going on is I have \[ŋ\] instead of \[n\] in the first syllable, possibly analogous to <i>anxious</i>, and the \[k\] slips in there as I transition from the velar nasal to the post-alveolar fricative.

-   <i>big</i> has a bit of raising towards the end of the vowel. I'd transcribe it as \[bɪi̯ɡ\]. I don't have it in any other /ɪɡ/ word, as far as I know, not even <i>pig</i>.

-   <i>want</i> is \[wʌnt\]. So, <i>wants</i> is homophonous with <i>once</i>.

-   I 100% say <i>camouflage</i> as "camel-flage". So I have an extra /l/ in there.

-   The last syllable of <i>kindergarten</i> has a /d/ underlyingly rather than /t/.

-   The default way I say <i>grandma</i> is \[ɡɹæ̃mə\].

<br/> 

## Other things

### Phonological

-   /t/ and /d/ before /ɹ/ (as in <i>try</i>, <i>train</i>, <i>dry</i>, and <i>drain</i>) are affricated to \[tʃɹ\] and \[dʒɹ\]. In other words, little kid me would spell them as "chry" and "jrain".

-   I raise /æ/ before nasals but not in other environments.

### Grammatical

-   Even though I grew up in the  Midwest, I do not have *needs washed* or positive *anymore*.

-   I'm not a native user of double modals, but I've started using *might should*.

-   I can say *ones* after plural demonstratives *these ones*. I'm still not sure if I have it after possessors, like *Charlie's ones* or *my one*.[Thanks Laurel for pointing me to [Thoms (2022)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FrGlNDaaNnZHN_4upx0U964qFfy4CNx4/view)!]{.aside}

### Lexical

-   I pronounce the \<l\> in words like <i>psalm</i>, <i>alm</i>, <i>palm</i>, <i>qualm</i>. I also pronounce it in <i>wolf</i>, <i>yolk</i>, and <i>folk</i>. I know I used to insert an \[ɫ\] in <i>both</i> and <i>local</i>, but I don't think I do that anymore. I do do it in <i>only</i> though.

-   The second syllable of <i>caterpiller</i> doesn't have an /ɹ/ underlyingly: /kætəpɪlɚ/

-   <i>lair</i> is homophonous with <i>layer</i> and does not rhyme with <i>hair</i>.

-   I don't pronounce the \<t\> in <i>often</i>.

-   Though both my parents grew up north of the <i>on</i> line and therefore have <sc>lot</sc> in <i>on</i>, I don't, so <i>on</i> is firmly <sc>thought</sc>.

-   I don't have the <i>pin-pen</i> merger, but I have /ɪ/ in <i>par<u>e</u>ntheses</i> and /ɛ/ in <i>s<u>y</u>mmetry</i>.

-   I consistently say <i>settler</i> with three syllables (\[sɛ.ɾl̩.ɚ\]) and not two (\*\[sɛʔ.lɚ\]), even when saying the name of the game <i>Settlers of Catan</i>.

-   I think I say <i>violet</i> with two syllables, meaning it's \[ˈvɑɪ.lɨt\] instead of \[ˈvɑɪ.ə.lət\]. However, <i>alveolar</i> does have a very short schwa, so it's \[æɫˈvi.ə.lɚ\], which does not rhyme with <i>velar</i> \[ˈvi.lɚ\].

-   I say the final syllable of *astronaut* with <sc>lot</sc>, as if it were "astro-not," rather than the probably more etymologically accurate <sc>thought</sc>, as if it were "astro-naught." I do say *nautical* with <sc>thought</sc>, so I think this is just a quirk about this one word.  

## My kids' speech

Since my kids are growing up in an area different from where I grew up, they will likely acquire a different variety of English from my own. Here's a list of things I've heard my 7-year-old say that is different from my own speech.

- *kindergarten* has a clear \[t\], i.e \[kʰɨndɚɡɑɹtʰɨn\] while I definitely have an underlying /d/ there.

- The full *cot-caught* merger, though she had that before she started school. In New England at least, Dan Johnson found that when a child's mother is merged, "a distinct father may actually make girls more merged" ([2000:79](https://read.dukeupress.edu/pads/issue/95/1)).

- Occasional use of \[ʔɨn\] in words like <i>Martin</i>.

- Occasional lowering of /il/ to [ɪɫ] in words like *feel*. 

- Occasionally inserting a velar stop after /ŋ/ as in [sɪ̃ŋk] *sing*.
