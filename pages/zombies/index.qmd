title: Zombie Chant

Every time I teach basic phonetics/phonology, I give students [this assignment](/downloads/250130_PraatHW.pdf). It's a good assignment that walks them through making recordings and TextGrids in Praat and teaches them that sounds are not as discrete as you might think.

But as a funny thing each year, I use a Praat script to take all the audio recordings, edit them so they're the same length, and then concatenate them. The result is some zombie/cult-sounding chant of this very basic sentence. I think it's hilarious, so you get to enjoy it too.

| year | students | recording |
|----------|----------|-----------| 
| 2017 | 26 | <audio src="2017Fall.wav"   controls preload></audio> |
| 2019 | 19 | <audio src="2019Spring.wav" controls preload></audio> |
| 2024 | 10 | <audio src="2024Winter.wav" controls preload></audio> |
| 2025 | 16 | <audio src="2025Winter.wav" controls preload></audio> |
| All  | 76 | <audio src="all_2025.wav"   controls preload></audio> |

Anyway, it's stupid but I love it.
