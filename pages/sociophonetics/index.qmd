This page houses the tutorials for L590R Sociophonetics. The ultimate goal is for interested students to go from zero coding experience to being able to create a good vowel plot. 


<!-- https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/3505 Looks like I can't really make a book within my main webpage. So I'd have to do something like sociophonetics.joeystanley.com, which I don't mind. Andrew Heiss' coureses are also a great example of what a full version would look like.-->

## Series 1: Getting to a basic vowel plot

In this series, we'll go from zero coding experience to creating a basic vowel plot in R. 

### Week 1: [Getting started with R and RStudio](/pages/sociophonetics/getting_started)

This tutorial will give a little background on R and RStudio and will walk you through the (simple) installation process. It should take just a few minutes. You won't need to do any coding. 

### Week 2: [R Basics](/pages/sociophonetics/r_basics)

This week, you'll get your hands dirty with R. You'll learn the basics of a few commands, how to get data into R, some basic visuals, and where to go for help.

### Week 4: Tidyverse

Learn about an entire ecosystem of additional R packages that makes analysis and processing easier.

### Week 5: ggplot2

Learn the basics of plotting using ggplot2.

### Week 6: F1-F2 plots

Learn how to make a basic scatter plot of vowel formants

### Week 7: Plotting vowel trajectories

Learn how to work with vowel trajectories and the two main ways you can plot those. 

## Series 2: Collecting Phonetic Data

In this series, we'll go back to the beginning stages of the data collection process. We'll see transcription, forced-alignment, and formant extraction---basically all the skills you need to go from raw audio to a spreadsheet of usable formants.

### DARLA

Do the complete pipeline from start to finish.

### Whisper

Automatically transcribe your audio with AI.

### MFA

Align utterance-level transcriptions to audio to create phoneme-level transcriptions.

### Basic Praat

Learn the basics of Praat and Praat scripting

### Extracting vowel formants with Praat

Learn how to extract vowel formants using a Praat script.

### FastTrack

Extract vowel formant measurements.

### New-Fave

Extract vowel formant measurements using the lattest algorithms.


## Series 3: Data processing

In this series, we'll look at the middle stage of data processing: going from a raw spreadsheet of formant measurements to cleaned up versions suitable for statistical analysis and data visualization.

### Coding allophones

Not all allophones of a phoneme should be treated the same. Learn how to split your data up into various allophones so they can be handled individually. 

### Outliers

Learn various ways to detect and handle outliers and extreme measurements. 

### Normalizing

Every vocal tract is different, so their formant measurements will be different. Learn how to transform your data so you can compare speakers apples-to-apples.

### Order of operaions

Learn how the order of these processing steps can affect your data and what the recommended order should be. 

## Series 4: Data visualization

In this series, we'll just focus on making good plots. We'll look at aesthetics and what makes for a good plot. We'll also explore additional ways of visualizing data. 

### Color

Learn to use color appropriately. 

### Themes and aesthetics

Learn to make your plot look nice and how to consistently apply that look across all your plots. 

### Animations

Learn to make really cool animations of vowel data!
