This page houses the tutorials for L590R Sociophonetics. The ultimate goal is for interested students to go from zero coding experience to being able to create a good vowel plot. 


## Week 1: [Getting started with R and RStudio](/pages/sociophonetics/getting_started)

This tutorial will give a little background on R and RStudio and will walk you through the (simple) installation process. It should take just a few minutes. You won't need to do any coding. 

## Week 2: [R Basics](/pages/sociophonetics/r_basics)

This week, you'll get your hands dirty with R. You'll learn the basics of a few commands, how to get data into R, some basic visuals, and where to go for help.

<!-- https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/3505 Looks like I can't really make a book within my main webpage. So I'd have to do something like sociophonetics.joeystanley.com, which I don't mind. Andrew Heiss' coureses are also a great example of what a full version would look like.-->
