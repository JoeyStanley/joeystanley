This page houses the tutorials for L590R Sociophonetics. The ultimate goal is for interested students to go from zero coding experience to being able to create a good vowel plot. 

<!-- https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/3505 Looks like I can't really make a book within my main webpage. So I'd have to do something like sociophonetics.joeystanley.com, which I don't mind. Andrew Heiss' coureses are also a great example of what a full version would look like.-->
