This page contains resources to help you learn more about linguistic discrimination. These resources were compiled by the Coalition Against Linguistic Discrimination (CALD) at Brigham Young Universisty. The page is in its infancy, so there are not too many things yet, but we hope to add more resources soon. For more information about CALD, please contact Joey Stanley at joey_stanley@byu.edu.


## [Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000104267_eng)

This document was drafted in 1996 and was signed by several non-government organizations to support basic linguistic rights, particularly for endangered languages.

## [The Accentism Project](https://accentism.org)

This project has the aim of uncovering and challenging such discrimination in everyday life. The site provides the opportunity for people to share their own stories and experiences of language-based bias, prejudice, and discrimination.

This site contains first-hand accounts by those who have experienced linguistic discrimination (paprticularly in the United Kingdom), a summary of research that has been done, a list of accentism being featured in the media, and training for businesses.
