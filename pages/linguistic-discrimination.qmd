This page contains resources to help you learn more about linguistic discrimination. These resources were compiled by the Coalition Against Linguistic Discrimination (CALD) at Brigham Young University. The page is in its infancy, so there are not too many things yet, but we hope to add more resources soon. For more information about CALD, please contact Joey Stanley at joey_stanley@byu.edu.

1. To understand the causes and effects of any bias and provide an informed, evidence-based understanding of attitudes to accents in the UK today.

1. To test tools, training and techniques that can be used to combat bias.

The site also includes practical resources, reports of their research, and datasets to explore.
