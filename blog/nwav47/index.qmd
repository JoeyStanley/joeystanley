Today, I gave a poster presentation on prevelar raising. As it turns out, despite <sc>beg</sc> and <sc>bag</sc> being relatively small lexical classes, I found phonological, morphological, and lexical effects on the degree of raising, and that the two vowel classes reacted to these influences differently.

So for some speakers, mostly in the Pacific Northwest, the Upper Midwest, and Canada, they raise the <sc>dress</sc> (<sc>beg</sc>) and <sc>trap</sc> (<sc>bag</sc>) vowels before voiced velars. The idea for this research mostly came about because I was trying to figure out whether I have <sc>beg</sc>-raising. Turns out, I do, except for in a few words like *integrity*, *negligible*, and *segregate* which seems somewhat unexpected.

So I set up a categorization task that I distributed via Reddit. I showed people a bunch of <sc>beg</sc> and <sc>bag</sc> words and asked them whether the vowel in their pronunciation is most like that in *bake*, *deck*, or *back*. Almost 7,000 people took the survey and I got over 500,000 observations.

As it turns out, there were clear phonological effects for <sc>beg</sc>. If the /É¡/ was followed by a sonorant (as in *regular* or *segment*), particular a liquid (*negligible* or *segregate*), it was indicated to be raised less. Adding suffixes had different effects: people indicated a raised vowel more when *-ed* was added to verbs, but only for <sc>bag</sc>. There were lexical effects too: for <sc>bag</sc>, more frequent words were raised more, borrowings with <sc>beg</sc> were raised more, and <sc>beg</sc> words with orthographic \<ex\> (like *exile* or *exit*) were virtually never raised. 

The takeaway is that even though these are relatively marginal lexical classes, they still have interesting language-internal factors. And, even though <sc>beg</sc>- and <sc>bag</sc>-raising are generally considered to be the same phenomenon of prevelar raising, the two are different. There are some major limitations here, particularly because reported speech is never completely reliable, so I'd like to follow up with an acoustic study. But, I think it's important to include many more words in a word list because some of these patterns would not have been found if a just small one was used.
