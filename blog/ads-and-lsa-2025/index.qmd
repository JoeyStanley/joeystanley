## Other Things

At the ADS Business Meeting, I was voted a member of the American Dialect Society Executive Committee! I replace Alicia Wassink, who was just voted President-Elect of the Linguistic Society of America. I'm excited to serve with Jessi Grieser, Nicole Rosen, and Paul Reed.

At that same meeting, I was also voted a Kurath Fund Trustee, which is a position within the Linguistic Atlas Project. I'll serve with Jennifer Cramer and Dennis Preston.

Finally, at the ADS Breakfast on Saturday morning, I received the 9t Audrey Duckert Memorial Travel Award to attend these ADS meetings. 

I'm so humbled to be considered for these positions and award! Thank you to all those who were involved!
