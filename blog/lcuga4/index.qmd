This weekend, I had the opportunity to present twice at the [4th Annual Linguistics Conference at UGA](http://www.linguistics.uga.edu/lcuga-4). One was planned and the other was a last-minute fill-in for someone who couldn't make it. I was happy to do both.

Friday's presentation was called *The linguistic effects of a changing timber industry: Language change in Cowlitz County, WA*. Here, I talk about some of the sudden linguistic changes that I found in apparent time and suggest that they had to do with changes in the timber industry around that time. Because this was last-minute, it is basically a precursor to (and a slideshow version of) my [NWAV46](/blog/nwav46) poster that I'll be giving in a few weeks. You can download the slides for this talk [here](/downloads/171006-LCUGA4-WA-slides.pdf)

Saturday's presentation with [Kyle Vanderniet](https://clyguy.wixsite.com/profile) was called *Consonantal variation in Utah English: What el[t]se is happening[k]?*. We talked about three variables that seem to be particularly salient in Utah English

1. The various pronunciation of words like *mountain*, *button*, or *satin* with the last syllables as [ʔn̩], [ʔɨn], or [tʰɨn].

1. Insertion of [t] between /ls/ clusters, as in *fal*[t]*se* or *el*[t]*se*. 

1. Realizing word-final *ing* as [ɪŋk].
