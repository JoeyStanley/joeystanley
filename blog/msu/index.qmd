This week, I had the distinct honor of giving an invited talk at Michigan State University as part of their Linguistics Colloquium Series. I always thought that invited talks like this, where the department actually flies you out, where mostly for people that seemed more influential and noteworthy than me. I never thought I'd have a chance to do something like this. It was a very flattering, ego-boosting, morale-lifting visit. 

It was a busy and exciting day for me, full of reconnecting with colleagues and meeting new, bright students. But the main event was my talk and you can download a copy of the slides [here](/downloads/251017-MSU.pdf). It is based on the introduction to the [edited volume](https://read.dukeupress.edu/pads/issue/109/1) that me, Peggy Renwick, and Monica Nesbitt did that talks about the Boomer--Gen X transition and its effect on regional varieties of American English.

I didn't get a good picture at all during the day, but I did wander around at night and took some awkward selfies.
