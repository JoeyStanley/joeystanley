I'm happy to report that I successfully defended my dissertation today! The [defense](/downloads/191209-dissertation_defense.pdf) was held in the DigiLab (300 Main Library). The study itself is called "Vowel Dynamics of the Elsewhere Shift: A sociophonetic analysis of English in Cowlitz County, Washington."
