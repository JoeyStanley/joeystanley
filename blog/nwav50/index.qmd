Today I gave a talk that Betsy Sneller and I have been working on called "How Sample Size Impacts Pillai Scores â€“ and What Sociophoneticians Should Do About It" at the 50th New Ways of Analyzing Variation conference in San Jose! This is an updateto what we presented at [ASA2021](/blog/asa2021).

We have three things you can download. 

1. First is [the actual powerpoint file](/downloads/221014-NWAV50_pillai.pptx). In the notes of each slide though you can see the actual script I read, so you can read every word that was said during the talk.

2. Next, if that's too much for you, you can download just [a PDF of the talk](/downloads/221014-NWAV50_pillai.pdf). In case you want this ligherweight version of the slides.

3. ~~Finally, here is the current manuscript that is under review with the *Journal of the Acoustical Society of America*. The final product will likely change somewhat, but most of the information is there.~~ [Edit (December 14, 2022): [Here](/downloads/221202-Pillai-preprint.pdf) is the accepted version.]

If you need to calculate Pillai scores in R, I've got a two-part tutorial for you ([here](/blog/a-tutorial-in-calculating-vowel-overlap) and [here](/blog/vowel-overlap-in-r-advanced-topics)). I also did a blog post ([here](/blog/pillai-scores-dont-change-after-normalization)) about how Pillai scores don't seem to change after normalization.
