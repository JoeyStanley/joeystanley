    "text": "I‚Äôm an Assistant Professor in Department of Linguistics at Brigham Young University specializing in sociophonetics, dialectology, and quantitative methods. In May 2020, I received my Ph.D in linguistics from the Department of Linguistics at the University of Georgia.\nMy primary area of research is on English in the western United States. My dissertation focused on English in Cowlitz County, Washington with an emphasis on uncovering variation in vowel formant trajectories. I am currently involved in several research projects on Utah English (on vowels, consonants and intonation), including a long-term project analyzing a collection of 750 interviews with residents of Heber City, Utah born in the early 20th Century.\nAs a graduate student, I was involved with Bill Kretzschmar and Peggy Renwick and the other student workers at the Linguistic Atlas Project. My job was to write and maintain many of the Praat, R, and Perl scripts we used in the lab; one product of this work is the Gazetteer of Southern Vowels. Together with Peggy Renwick and other collaborators, I am still actively involved in analyzing legacy southern speech, particularly in the state of Georgia.\nMy research has recently been focused on sociophonetic data analysis methods. Some of this stems from my time as a research assistant in the DigiLab in UGA‚Äôs main library where I gave workshops on R, Praat scripting, and data visualization. Nowadays, I run simulations on real and artificual sociophonetic data, uncovering some overlooked aspects of methods that may in fact be rather important. (See my papers on Order of Operations and Pillai Scores.)\nI publish under the more grown-up-sounding version of my name, Joseph A. Stanley, but anyone who has ever met me knows I go by Joey.  I live in Spanish Fork with my wife (Kelly) and kids (Lena and Walter). I enjoy running, breadmaking, succulents, and playing the organ too loudly. A description of my idiolect can be found here."

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nI first heard about the tapes a little over three years ago. In January 2018, the LSA annual meeting was in Salt Lake City. Wanting to take advantage of the trip out there, I applied for and received a grant from the University of Georgia to collect audio in Heber City, aiming for multiple generations within a family to track language change over time. I decided on Heber partly because it was a region of Utah that had never been the subject of acoustic (let alone linguistic) analysis, as far as I know. My parents were living there at the time too, so they could hook me up with some potential contacts.\nSo on the morning of the first day of my fieldwork,Side note, it‚Äôs amazing that I heard about this goldmine literally through the first person I talked to while doing fieldwork? Who knew that there‚Äôd be such an amazing collection of audio sitting in someone‚Äôs basement nearby? In fact, there could be lots of collections like these, just collecting dust in people‚Äôs basements. All it takes is to find the right person! the first thing I did was go to the Heber Valley Visitor‚Äôs Center as a way to potentially find some contacts. Literally the first person I talked to told me about a man who had a huge collection of tapes. One person led me to another, and I was talking to an elderly man named Norm Kohler in his nursing home.\nNorm was a beloved middle school teacher in Heber City in the 1980s and 1990s. As a history project, he had each of his students get a cassette tape and interview a grandparent. I don‚Äôt know what the interview questions were, but I think they mostly concerned life in Heber Valley. He kept all the tapes his students turned in and, over the course of two decades, he ended up with over 1200 interviews! Norm intended to compile them and put together an oral history of the town, but unfortunately was unable to do so. So, just weeks before I met him, he decided it was best to return the tapes to the family members‚Äô of his students and the people they interviewed. So he put an ad in the paper and hundreds of people claimed their tapes and were able to hear their ancestors‚Äô voices, perhaps for the first time.\nHowever, not all the tapes were claimed. I was told a few hundred remained. So, after Norm passed away a few months later, his family held on to them for a while before finally donating them to the Midway Historical Society. (Midway is the town next door to Heber.) Several complications made it difficult for me to get access to the tapes, including outdated contact information on Midway‚Äôs website, the society going on an extended hiatus, me living in Georgia, and then covid. But I did my best to reach out to anyone who might know about where the tapes were being stored.\nFinally, on Thursday this week, I was contacted by the historian in custody of the tapes. She asked if I was still interested in them, and I most definitely am! So we had a nice chat about what my goals were for them and what the goals were for the Historical Society, and we think there‚Äôs mutual interest in getting them digitized and transcribed. So, the next day, yesterday, she happened to be in Provo so she dropped off about half of the tapes‚Äî452 of them!‚Äîat my office!\nSo after three years of following tenuous leads, I finally have the tapes!"

    "title": "Kohler Tapes",
    "section": "Why am I so interested?",
    "text": "Why am I so interested?\nI am a linguist, so why should I care about these tapes? Well, the obvious reason is that it‚Äôs a lot of audio. For my dissertation I analyzed about 40 hours of interviews and that was already a lot of data. This is at least 10 times the amount of audio. In fact, it‚Äôs about the size of the Digital Archive of Southern Speech, a subset of the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States, that I spent four years in grad school analyzing. So having access to this much audio is absolutely incredible\nBut it‚Äôs not just the amount of audio. There are dozens of oral history projects even in Utah. This particular set is attractive for several reasons:\n\nThe nature of the homework assignment ensured good metadata. A few tapes have already been digitized and they all start off introducing the interviewer (the middle-schooler) and the interviewee, with information like the date of interview, their age, and where they grew up.\nBecause these were all students in the same smallish town in UtahThere were about 4500 people living in Heber in the 1980s and 1990s, which means this sample represents like a significant chunk of the community! the sample will be relatively homogeneous geographically. While it doesn‚Äôt ensure that the interviewees (the grandparents) were from Heber or Heber Valley generally, my guess is that a significant number of them are.\nTypically, interviews happen with a historian or someone that the interviewer is unfamiliar with. In sociolinguistics, it‚Äôs generally accepted that the degree of familiarity with the interviewer can have an influence on a person‚Äôs speech. In all cases with these tapes, the interviewer is a teenager and a grandchild of the interviewee. So that lowers the formality of the situation and will likely mean that the interviewees‚Äô speech will be more casual.\nHeber Valley has been the focus of very little acoustic research. There may be occasional interviews as parts of the Linguistic Atlas Project or the Dictionary of Regional American English, but no study, as far as I know, has focused on Heber. Instead, most research looks at people from Utah Valley and Salt Lake Valley. This collection of interviews will offer a new spot on the map of Utah dialectology and a nice point of comparison between more urban and more rural areas of the state.\nI have virtually no metadata about the interviewees right now, but if their grandchildren were about 14 years old in the 1980s and 1990s, then the speakers in these tapes were born perhaps sometime between 1900 and 1940. There has been some research on the development of Utah English, mostly by David Bowie, but he acknowledges that it was based on public sermons given by upper-class white men. This collection offers a unique look into how other Utahns born around that time talked. And since I have some comparable data from contemporary Heber City residents, I can begin to look at language change in real time.\n\nSo there are lots of reasons for why I‚Äôm really interested in this collection of tapes. And that‚Äôs on top of the oral history the Midway Historical Society wants to create based on them."

    "section": "Looking Ahead",
    "text": "Looking Ahead\nLuckily, I‚Äôve had some experience working on a project of this size. For four years at the University of Georgia, I was a part of the team that processed the Digital Archive of Southern Speech, which is a 367-hour subset of the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States. So I‚Äôve sat in on transcriber training sessions, seen what kinds of obstacles get in the way of processing, managed thousands of files, and analyzed spreadsheets with a couple million acoustic measurements in them. However, that was only as a graduate student. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lot that goes on behind the scenes as a PI that I didn‚Äôt see.\nTranscribers‚ÄîSome back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that I‚Äôll need a sizable grant to get this all processed. Again, I don‚Äôt have definite numbers for anything, I know my 452 tapes are a little over half of them, so let‚Äôs say there are 700 tapes total. They‚Äôre all at least 30 minutes long and I know many went longer, so if I average say 40 minutes per tape, that‚Äôs 28,000 minutes or roughly 467 hours. I think the the transcribers for DASS averaged about 13 hours per 50 minutes of audio or so, but this audio is newer and I presume Utah transcribers will be more familiar with Utah speakers I think, so I‚Äôll estimate 10 hours of work per tape. That‚Äôs 4670 hours of transcription. At $15 per hour, I‚Äôm looking at about $70,000 in student wages. Obviously, I can‚Äôt get that much coin internally so it sounds like this is only going to happen with an external grant.\nGrad student workers‚ÄîThat‚Äôs of course assuming that the only wages I‚Äôll need to pay for are transcribers. This might be getting into ‚ÄúIf you give a mouse a cookie‚Äù territory, but it would be nice to have some grad students helping out with the project. At UGA, we had at least four and as many as six grad students involved in the project at a time. There was a lot of overlap between our duties, but very roughly speaking, one managed the transcribers, one managed the spot-checks, one managed the acoustic analysis, and one did miscellaneous duties. We were all involved in analysis, and a few others popped in for a semester or two to do additional analysis or perform other duties. To lighten my load, it would be handy to have perhaps three grad students manage the transcribers, check their work, and do the acoustic analysis. I‚Äôm fuzzy on what costs are associated with RA-ships at BYU, but I do know it‚Äôll add significantly to the total cost of the project.\nTime‚ÄîHow long will transcriptions take? I‚Äôve done transcriptions and they‚Äôre soul-sucking work. Even when I was highly motivated to process my own dissertation data, that I collected myself, and under a bit of a time crunch, I could barely put in more than about two hours a day. I surely don‚Äôt expect undergraduate transcribers to do more than 10 hours a week. When motivated by money, I‚Äôve seen some at UGA do more, but those students were exceptional. I‚Äôll estimate five hours of work per transcriber per week. So under the assumption of 4670 hours of work total, that‚Äôs 934 transcriber-weeks. If a semester is fifteen weeks, that‚Äôs 62 transcriber-semesters. If I set a goal of getting all the work done in two years (six semesters if you include summers), it would take ten or eleven transcribers to do it in two years. Of course, these are all very rough estimates, but managing several tens of thousands of dollars and almost a dozen workers for two years is not something I expected to do right away!\nDigitizing‚ÄîRegardless of the cost, number of workers, and time involved, the first step of the process will be digitization. Fortunately, it sounds like the Office of Digital Humanities can take care of that for me! Wow! So my short term goal is to get a batch‚Äîmaybe 30 or 50 tapes‚Äîdone first. While they work on digitizing the next batch, I can get started on listening to the first few minutes of the completed tapes and extracting whatever metadata I can from them. Eventually, all the tapes will be digitized and I can have a more concrete idea of how much audio (and consequently, people, time, hours, and money) I‚Äôm looking at.\nMetadata‚ÄîAfter digitizing all of them, my next step will be to finish collecting the metadata. It‚Äôll be nice to have a clear picture of birth years, genders, and birthplaces for all 700 or so people. The most likely scenario is that I won‚Äôt get an external grant because they‚Äôre extremely competitive, so I‚Äôll have to prioritize which ones to transcribe first. The Historical Society would like to start with some of the prominent members of the community and descendants of the town‚Äôs founders. I‚Äôd like to find a balance of genders and birth years too, so we‚Äôll probably settle on a subset that satisfies both of our needs. How big? I‚Äôm thinking between 35 and 70 (5% to 10% of the tapes). That‚Äôs a more reasonably-sized project that I could possibly get funded internally. It could provide me at least a beginning look at the speech community which would help seed an external grant.\nFollow-up project?‚ÄîIn case I just need more data to analyze (ha!) wouldn‚Äôt it be cool to track down some of the tapes that were given away? Presumably, if an ad in the paper is what it took for the families to get them, then an ad might be a good place to start to find them. We‚Äôd digitize the tapes right there for people, give them a copy and return the tape to them of course, but then also add that to the collection for the oral history. I think it would be especially cool to interview those people themselves! That way we can get some contemporary data to compare the tapes to, as well as track change within the family. That‚Äôll have to wait until I get NSF grant number two!\nPublications‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs the end goal? Well, I‚Äôll obviously start cranking out some papers as soon as a reasonable amount of data has been processed. There is a lot going on in Utah English. Many of the stereotyped features are dying out, so these people may provide good acoustic data for what would otherwise be hard to study phonetically today. But there are also lots of other features that I believe are recent innovations, so if they‚Äôre infrequent or missing from these speakers, it‚Äôll help establish the timing of when they did develop. Even before I had the tapes, I‚Äôve been thinking a full analysis of this collection deserves a book-length treatment. It likely won‚Äôt get done before I‚Äôm up for tenure, but maybe it‚Äôll go towards my application for full professor."

Videos for some of these are available here. Below you will find materials for these workshops. I hope they are thorough enough that you can make use of them as stand-alone documents.\nThe data used in these workshops can be found at my datasets page.\nIf you are planning on attending a workshop in the near future, please see the setup instructions to help you get R and RStudio installed on your computer.\nNote: If you attended these workshops, please consider giving me some feedback with this anonymous survey so I can know how to improve.\n\n\n\nIn this first workshop I cover the basics of R itself. I talk about the differences between R and RStudio and I help folks get both installed and running on their computers. We create a simple ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù script using R. Part 2 covers the basics of the R language. It is also be a very simple introduction to some core computer coding concepts like declaring variables and variable types.\nAdditional Materials: You may also be interested in a PDF of the slides I used in Part 1 or a PDF version of Part 2‚Äôs handout. An older version that combines elements of both parts can be found here as a PDF or RMarkdown file.\n\n\n\n\nggplot2 is a widely used package that allows for high-quality visualizations. These workshops take you from installation to pretty advanced topics.\n\n\nIn Part 1 of this workshop I cover the basic syntax and how to make some simple types of plots.\n\n\n\nOften you‚Äôll want to customize your plots in some way. So, in Part 2, we cover how to mess with properties of the plots like the axes, colors, and legends to make the plot work better for you.\n\n\n\nApparently I had a lot to say about how to extend your ggplot2 skills, so I ended up creating a supplement with lots of additional detail on how to modify your plots. This handout will vary from time to time as I add to it when I learn new things or remove sections to incorporate them into future workshops.\n\n\n\nBased on a popular blog post I wrote, this workshop wraps all customization methods together and shows how to create your own themes.\n\n\n\nAs I was preparing for the custom themes workshop, I got a little carried away illustrating all the components of the theme function. I decided to simplify that portion of the workshop and create this separate handout that just focuses on theme. It is not yet finished, but it may be of some help to people (including myself!).\nAdditional Materials: You may also be interested in the 2018 versions of some of these workshops that I gave (Part 1 Rmarkdown and PDF and Part 2 RMarkdown and PDF). An older version from 2017 that combines elements of Parts 1 and 2 can be found here as a PDF or RMarkdown file.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse is a suite of packages that includes dplyr and tidyr which help you wrangle your data. In this two-part workshop, we learn some of the common functions in the tidyverse and compare them to base R, showing that there are multiple ways to accomplish the same task in R. Part 2 in particular looks at how to reshape and transform your data, merging it with other dataset, and other super useful and powerful tools.\nAdditional Materials: You may also be interested in PDFs for Part 1 and Part 2. An older version that combines elements of both parts can be found here as a PDF or RMarkdown file.\n\n\n\n\nR Markdown is a way to create different types of documents using R (pdfs, word files, html files). In this one-day crash course, I show how to make R Markdown files and the kinds of things they would be useful for.\nAdditional Materials: If you‚Äôd rather use a PDF of the workshop materials, there‚Äôs one available here.\n\n\n\n\nShiny is an R package that allows you to make your own interactive web pages. An entire semester could be devoted to Shiny and there‚Äôs a bit of a learning curve, especially if you haven‚Äôt used HTML before. This two-day workshop covers just the essentials.\nNote that the materials for this workshop include interactive shiny elements, which means I can‚Äôt host them on my own website. So instead, they‚Äôre hosted on Shiny‚Äôs free server space. But this comes with a major drawback: they‚Äôre only available for 25 user-hours a month. So, if the link above does not work for you, try again in a week or so. Sorry for the inconvenience."

So, in this workshop we cover how to mess with properties of the plots like the axes, colors, and legends to make the plot work better for you.\n\n\nApparently I had a lot to say about how to extend your ggplot2 skills, so I ended up creating a supplement with lots of additional detail on how to modify your plots."

I decided to simplify that portion of the workshop and create this separate handout that just focuses on theme. It is not yet finished, but it may be of some help to people (including myself!)."
