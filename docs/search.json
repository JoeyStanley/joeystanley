Here is a syllabus.\nPraat Tutorial—For homework, I often assign students mini-projects that involve the use of Praat. This assignment serves as a useful tutorial to downloading and running Praat for the first time. In it, I give detailed instructions on how to make and transcribe a sentence.\nFeatures Chart—When I was preparing to teach features for the first time, I found it hard to keep track of all of them so I started making a chart. It turned out to be pretty useful and I thought my students might like it too. It’s meant to act as reference rather than instruction, so you’ll still have to read through the relevant chapters to understand everything. It’s a lot of information to cram into a single page, so it’s still a work in progress to make it look better. It’s sort of one of those things that makes sense to the person who made it and no one else, so you’re milage may vary. I should have an accompanying “How to use this chart” guide. Maybe next time.\n\n\n\nI taught this Winter 2022 and Winter 2023. It’s similar to the Phonetics and Phonology course I taught already, but it cuts out most non-English material and goes into more depth into English. Here is a syllabus.\n\n\n\nI taught this undergraduate version of sociolinguistics in Winter 2021. You can look through the syllabus here. We followed Allan Bell’s The Guidebook to Sociolinguistics for the most part, though I threw in some additional topics towards the end.\n\n\n\nI taught this course in Winter 2021, Fall 2021, and Fall 2022. This is the graduate-level version of the Introduction to Sociolinguistics course above (so it’s still introductory course) and is similar to the undergraduate version except we take one day a week to read and discuss articles. Here is my most recent syllabus.\n\n\n\nI taught this course Spring of 2023 under the auspices of the senior capstone course, as well as as a linguistics elective, in the linguistics department. (So, technically it was cross-listed as LING 495R: Senior Capstone, ELING 495R: The Senior Course, LING 421R: Studies in Linguistics, and ELING 421R: Studies in Language or Editing).\nThe capstone courses in my deaprtment are designed to be open-ended and end up being special topics courses that cover a wide range of subfields in linguistics. Most of the faculty who had been teaching these capstone courses though had recently retired, so we have been in dire need for new courses to put into the rotation. I had wanted to teaching something about language ideology/discrimination/attitudes but I was asked to do something to do with American English; we settled on African American English, which I think was a nice compromise.\nSo, with the help and input from many friends and colleagues, I designed and prepped the course from scratch, using Lisa Green’s African American English as my main textbook. I went into the course knowing some things here and there about AAE from just being exposed to the literature on it in sociolinguistics, and it turned out to be a very challenging but richly rewarding course for me. Here is the syllabus.\n\n\n\nThis is a special topics course that I taught with Lisa Johnson in Winter 2023. We used Natalie Schilling’s textbook of the same name as our guide and did a Utah County–based implementation of similar courses taught in other universities. (Our “fieldsite” that we chose was the city of Lehi.) The course involved going out to the field to conduct sociolinguistic interviews. You can see a syllabus here.\n\n\n\nI’ve taught this course four times so far. In Summer 2020, it was completely online and had a focus on the British Isles to make up for the study abroad to the UK and Ireland that was cancelled due to covid. In Fall 2020, Fall 2021, and Fall 2022 we covered around 30 varieties of English in three broad units: North America, the British Isles, and everywhere else. Here is my syllabus from Fall 2022.\n\n\n\nI taught this course in Fall 2020 and Fall 2021. It covers how to conduct a linguistics study and covers software like Zotero, Word, Excel, Praat, AntConc, Qualtrics, and Jamovi with an introduction to statistics scattered throughout. Here is a syllabus from when I taught it in Fall 2021.\n\n\n\nThis is a special topics course that I taught with Earl Brown in Fall 2022. We be built upon the version of the course he taught in Winter 2020. Here is the syllabus we started off with (though it did change quite a bit in the end).\n\n\n\nI team-taught this course in Winter 2021 with Dan Dewey and then by myself Winter 2022. Students end the semester with a prospectus for their MA thesis and walk away with some introductory statistics. Here is my most recent syllabus.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaleb Crumley, Jonathan Crum, and I led a series of three workshops on LaTeX as a way to introduce the new UGA Dissertation LaTeX template. I discussed basic LaTeX skills, Caleb showed how to use the template, and Jonathan illustrated more advanced topics. This series got the stamp of approval from the UGA Graduate School and had over 100 registered attendees.\n\n\n\nLisa Lipani and I led three workshops on Praat and Praat scripting. We discussed the basics of the Praat interface, how to code basic things, and then did one devoted to automatic extraction of formant measurements.\n\n\n\nIn a suite of five workshops, I discussed data visualization. Three of them were focused on ggplot2 (see the R workshops) but two were platform-independent and discussed the use of color and Edward Tufte’s principles of data visualization. Though they’re outside my discipline, I really enjoyed these workshops.\n\n\n\nI have led more than a dozen workshops on R on a variety of topics. In addition to just an intro to R, I’ve talked about the tidyverse, RMarkdown, and Shiny. I’ve done a handful just on ggplot2, and I have handouts ready for more detailed workshops on customizing plots in ggplot2 for future workshops.\n\n\n\nIn this workshops, I discuss ways to boost your online presence as an academic. I’ve given this workshop several times over the past few years and it has evolved quite a bit based on my own experiences. The gist: make a website and possibly also get active on Twitter.\n\n\n\nI gave a brief—and very opinionated—workshop on how to make an academic poster. I discuss overall design and layout, nit-picky things like font sizes and color, and content.\n\n\n\nI once gave a workshop on Excel. It was a while ago."

    "text": "This page highlights some of my research, organized thematically. I am a dialectologist, so several of my research interests are on specific regions. But intersecting these regions is where the sociolinguist in me comes out, and I try to uncover the meaning in linguistic variants—particularly the infrequent ones. And I go about these questions in these areas as a phonetician, analyzing speech production data and vowel trajectories. Finally, in nearly every study, I put on my quantitative linguist/data scientist/statistician cap when I actually do the analysis and interpretation. I think it’s a great intersection of subdisciplines within linguistics and I’m kept on my toes trying to keep up with each field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother area I focus on in the West is Utah. I worked on a poster involving vowel mergers over time in a single speaker. Most recently, I’ve been working with Kyle Vanderniet on consonantal variation in Utah English, as in the words mountain and false or in word-final -ing. I was also able to conduct additional fieldwork in Utah County but I’d really like to do some more. Utah is a unique place: its settlement history and highly concentrated Mormon population has had an impact on the English spoken in the region. I think it deserves some more attention by sociolinguists and dialectologists.\n\nJoseph A.

In my dissertation, I showed that the younger people are shifting their front lax vowels like in other parts of the US and Canada.

But, as a research assistant for the Linguistic Atlas Project for four years, I couldn’t help but begin analysis on DASS, a newly transcribed corpus of interviews from the 1970s and 1980s. Together with Peggy Renwick and the others at the Linguistic Atlas team, we’ve dug deep into the phonetics of how southerners, and more specifically Georgians, sounded a couple generations ago. You can see and interact with some of this data by going a site I made called the Gazetteer of Southern Vowels.\n\n\nJoseph A. Stanley, Jon Forrest, Lelia Glass, & Margaret E. L.

Available at: https://repository.upenn.edu/pwpl/vol28/iss2/17 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Traditional sociophonetic research analyzes vowels using a pair of measurements, usually somewhere near the midpoint of the vowel. We can get a greater understanding of vowels by extracting data at multiple timepoints per vowel. In particular, I think there is important sociolinguistic meaning encoded in formant trajectories. Much of my recent research has gone this route, and has used generalized additive mixed-effects models to analyze the resulting data. This type of analysis yields complex results and visualizations, but I think we’re starting to get a better idea of how vowels work while uncovering exciting new research questions and possibilities.\n\n\nJoseph A.

There are some speech patterns that are quite infrequent because the particular sequence of sounds only exists in a handful of words. For example, I’ve found phonological and regional patterns in words with /ɛɡ/ (beg, leg). I’ve also found that people in Utah have a tap in /θɹ/ clusters (three, throw) but Washingtonians don’t. Utahns also insert stops in /ls/ clusters (false, salsa). How infrequent can a variable be and still exhibit language-internal, regional, and sociolinguistic variability?\n\n\nJoseph A.

Today, their behavior, dress, and culture are much more mainstream, but their speech patterns might not always be. I’m curious about how Mormons talk, particularly in relation to non-Mormons and ex-Mormons. I’d also like to disentangle Mormonese from Utah English, because while they must overlap, I think they’re different in subtle ways. My new position at Brigham Young University will certainly give me better access to this population and I hope to soon uncover some new findings on Mormonese.\n\n\nJoseph A.

In May 2020, I received my Ph.D in linguistics from the Department of Linguistics at the University of Georgia.\nMy primary area of research is on English in the western United States. My dissertation focused on English in Cowlitz County, Washington with an emphasis on uncovering variation in vowel formant trajectories. I am currently involved in several research projects on Utah English (on vowels, consonants and intonation), including a long-term project analyzing a collection of 750 interviews with residents of Heber City, Utah born in the early 20th Century.\nAs a graduate student, I was involved with Bill Kretzschmar and Peggy Renwick and the other student workers at the Linguistic Atlas Project. My job was to write and maintain many of the Praat, R, and Perl scripts we used in the lab; one product of this work is the Gazetteer of Southern Vowels. Together with Peggy Renwick and other collaborators, I am still actively involved in analyzing legacy southern speech, particularly in the state of Georgia.\nMy research has recently been focused on sociophonetic data analysis methods. Some of this stems from my time as a research assistant in the DigiLab in UGA’s main library where I gave workshops on R, Praat scripting, and data visualization. Nowadays, I run simulations on real and artificial sociophonetic data, uncovering some overlooked aspects of methods that may in fact be rather important. (See my papers on Order of Operations and Pillai Scores.)\nI publish under the more grown-up-sounding version of my name, Joseph A. Stanley, but anyone who has ever met me knows I go by Joey.

    "text": "As a part of my research assistantship this year, I work with the Linguistic Atlas Project, under the direction of Dr. William Kretzschmar. It’s an exciting project to be a part of.\nThere is a lot going on in the lab right now. We’ve got a team of over a dozen undergrad transcribers working dutifully on an NSF grant awarded to Kretzschmar and Dr. Peggy Renwick, not to mention the web developers for the Atlas Project and for Complex Systems.\nOne of the things I’m excited about is that I now have access to all the data for the Atlas Projects from over half a century ago. In a nutshell, what happened is that in the 30s and through the 50s and 60s, Hans Kurath and a team of researchers set out to document the language geography of the United States and Canada. Armed with whatever recording devices they could afford, several hours’ worth of interview questions, and expert phonetic transcribers, they set out to document all the accents and dialects of English in North America.\nThey were partially successful. Starting in New England and in the East, they talked to a couple thousand people, painstakingly analyzed the data, and published a couple multi-volume works specifically focused on certain areas of the United States. Thus, we have the Linguistic Atlases of New England (LANE), the Gulf States (LAGS), and the Upper Midwest (LAUM). However, funding was cut short. Realizing they may have bitten off more than they can chew, the data collected in other portions of the country was never published, other than some brief overviews by some of the researchers. Time passed, and for one reason or another, the majority of this unpublished data disappeared into obscurity.\nBy the late 1970s and into the 1980s, the original handwritten field notes and any extant recordings were scattered across multiple locations. The original researchers’ dream to publish this data for a general audience was never fulfilled, let alone the majority of potential publications for a more specialized audience. The data was always supposed to be accessible to anyone interested, and just a few decades later it was collecting dust in basements, accessible to probably the half a dozen people that knew about it.\nIn 1983 some of the data was under threat of being thrown out. Luckily, William Kretzschmar offered to take all the data from all projects and house it at the University of Georgia. Since then, he has been in the process of realizing the original researchers’ dream of making the data accessible. In the 21st century, that means digitizing it all and putting it online. And there has been success in that endeavor.\nThis is where I come in. As a lowly out-of-state grad student, I’m not particularly concerned with language around Georgia, as interesting as it is. I do however like research on the opposite side of the country: the Pacific Northwest. Only after reading about the Linguistic Atlas of the Pacific Northwest (LAPNW) did I realize that all that data was being housed by my own university. So as soon as I was offered the assistantship in the Linguistic Atlas office, I expressed interest in the LAPNW data. Well, just today, I made a visit to the repository where all the data is held.\nAfter sitting alone for half an hour on the concrete floor literally in the furthest corner in that warehouse, I was quickly able to assess the situation. From what I’ve been able to tell, there are just four boxes of LAPNW data. Compared to the dozens of boxes in the large-scale projects (LANE, LAGS, etc.), it’s a meager project. One box contains the original handwritten notes for about half of the 51 participants, which is great, but I’m a little sad that some of the originals have been lost. But the other three boxes were all copies, including a complete set for all participants and another partial set. I don’t know who did the photocopies or when they were done, but I’m really glad we have them.\nSo, I brought them back to the office and I’ve started to look through them. It’s a bit exciting for me actually. Since being housed at UGA, I don’t know if these boxes have been opened by anyone. As far as I know, there are probably ten people in the world that would be interested in the LAPNW data, and certainly none of them have had the ability to peruse UGA’s repository. So this stuff literally hasn’t seen the light of day for decades. I don’t know what I’m going to do with this goldmine, but I’d sure like to revive it somehow and possibly do what I can to make it accessible. It’s an exciting time for me."

However, I do remember spending a large chunk of my time at that conference in the ADS presentations. In fact I still talk about some of the presentations I saw there.\nTwo years later, the LSA and its sister societies met in Portland. Being a short drive from where my wife grew up, we decided to fly out so she could see her family and so I could attend the conference. Again, I found myself almost exclusively attending the ADS meetings. (Part of that may have been that it was up on like the 23rd floor and the room had a fantastic view!) I recognized people from the Boston meeting (Tyler Kendall, Sali Tagliamonte, etc.) and was also able to put some faces to names I had read (Charles Boberg, David Bowie, etc.). As it turns out, there were several presentations on language in the West that I ended up citing in some of my own work.\nNow, two years later, I’m extremely happy to be presenting at the 2017 meeting. Now that I have a clear idea about what my research interests are, and I know many more scholars’ works besides recognizing their name, I hope to reach out and talk with many of these people. Hopefully I’ll come across less of a fan and more as a colleague.\nI get to present a portion of my data that I collected in Washington just a few months ago. In a nutshell I’m showing that in word lists people pronounce pull and pole the same but Mary and merry different, but in a minimal pair task, pull and pole are separate while Mary and merry are the same.\nI’m about to give two completely unrelated presentations soon, so my focus hasn’t been on this Pacific Northwest, but once that wave has passed I’ll be able to devote more time and energy into this. It’s a very exciting time for me and I really look forward to the conference."

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nI first heard about the tapes a little over three years ago. In January 2018, the LSA annual meeting was in Salt Lake City. Wanting to take advantage of the trip out there, I applied for and received a grant from the University of Georgia to collect audio in Heber City, aiming for multiple generations within a family to track language change over time. I decided on Heber partly because it was a region of Utah that had never been the subject of acoustic (let alone linguistic) analysis, as far as I know. My parents were living there at the time too, so they could hook me up with some potential contacts.\nSo on the morning of the first day of my fieldwork,Side note, it’s amazing that I heard about this goldmine literally through the first person I talked to while doing fieldwork? Who knew that there’d be such an amazing collection of audio sitting in someone’s basement nearby? In fact, there could be lots of collections like these, just collecting dust in people’s basements. All it takes is to find the right person! the first thing I did was go to the Heber Valley Visitor’s Center as a way to potentially find some contacts. Literally the first person I talked to told me about a man who had a huge collection of tapes. One person led me to another, and I was talking to an elderly man named Norm Kohler in his nursing home.\nNorm was a beloved middle school teacher in Heber City in the 1980s and 1990s. As a history project, he had each of his students get a cassette tape and interview a grandparent. I don’t know what the interview questions were, but I think they mostly concerned life in Heber Valley. He kept all the tapes his students turned in and, over the course of two decades, he ended up with over 1200 interviews! Norm intended to compile them and put together an oral history of the town, but unfortunately was unable to do so. So, just weeks before I met him, he decided it was best to return the tapes to the family members’ of his students and the people they interviewed. So he put an ad in the paper and hundreds of people claimed their tapes and were able to hear their ancestors’ voices, perhaps for the first time.\nHowever, not all the tapes were claimed. I was told a few hundred remained. So, after Norm passed away a few months later, his family held on to them for a while before finally donating them to the Midway Historical Society. (Midway is the town next door to Heber.) Several complications made it difficult for me to get access to the tapes, including outdated contact information on Midway’s website, the society going on an extended hiatus, me living in Georgia, and then covid. But I did my best to reach out to anyone who might know about where the tapes were being stored.\nFinally, on Thursday this week, I was contacted by the historian in custody of the tapes. She asked if I was still interested in them, and I most definitely am! So we had a nice chat about what my goals were for them and what the goals were for the Historical Society, and we think there’s mutual interest in getting them digitized and transcribed. So, the next day, yesterday, she happened to be in Provo so she dropped off about half of the tapes—452 of them!—at my office!\nSo after three years of following tenuous leads, I finally have the tapes!"

    "section": "Why am I so interested?",
    "text": "Why am I so interested?\nI am a linguist, so why should I care about these tapes? Well, the obvious reason is that it’s a lot of audio. For my dissertation I analyzed about 40 hours of interviews and that was already a lot of data. This is at least 10 times the amount of audio. In fact, it’s about the size of the Digital Archive of Southern Speech, a subset of the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States, that I spent four years in grad school analyzing. So having access to this much audio is absolutely incredible\nBut it’s not just the amount of audio. There are dozens of oral history projects even in Utah. This particular set is attractive for several reasons:\n\nThe nature of the homework assignment ensured good metadata. A few tapes have already been digitized and they all start off introducing the interviewer (the middle-schooler) and the interviewee, with information like the date of interview, their age, and where they grew up.\nBecause these were all students in the same smallish town in UtahThere were about 4500 people living in Heber in the 1980s and 1990s, which means this sample represents like a significant chunk of the community! the sample will be relatively homogeneous geographically. While it doesn’t ensure that the interviewees (the grandparents) were from Heber or Heber Valley generally, my guess is that a significant number of them are.\nTypically, interviews happen with a historian or someone that the interviewer is unfamiliar with. In sociolinguistics, it’s generally accepted that the degree of familiarity with the interviewer can have an influence on a person’s speech. In all cases with these tapes, the interviewer is a teenager and a grandchild of the interviewee. So that lowers the formality of the situation and will likely mean that the interviewees’ speech will be more casual.\nHeber Valley has been the focus of very little acoustic research. There may be occasional interviews as parts of the Linguistic Atlas Project or the Dictionary of Regional American English, but no study, as far as I know, has focused on Heber. Instead, most research looks at people from Utah Valley and Salt Lake Valley. This collection of interviews will offer a new spot on the map of Utah dialectology and a nice point of comparison between more urban and more rural areas of the state.\nI have virtually no metadata about the interviewees right now, but if their grandchildren were about 14 years old in the 1980s and 1990s, then the speakers in these tapes were born perhaps sometime between 1900 and 1940. There has been some research on the development of Utah English, mostly by David Bowie, but he acknowledges that it was based on public sermons given by upper-class white men. This collection offers a unique look into how other Utahns born around that time talked. And since I have some comparable data from contemporary Heber City residents, I can begin to look at language change in real time.\n\nSo there are lots of reasons for why I’m really interested in this collection of tapes. And that’s on top of the oral history the Midway Historical Society wants to create based on them."

    "text": "Looking Ahead\nLuckily, I’ve had some experience working on a project of this size. For four years at the University of Georgia, I was a part of the team that processed the Digital Archive of Southern Speech, which is a 367-hour subset of the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States. So I’ve sat in on transcriber training sessions, seen what kinds of obstacles get in the way of processing, managed thousands of files, and analyzed spreadsheets with a couple million acoustic measurements in them. However, that was only as a graduate student. I’m sure there’s a lot that goes on behind the scenes as a PI that I didn’t see.\nTranscribers—Some back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that I’ll need a sizable grant to get this all processed. Again, I don’t have definite numbers for anything, I know my 452 tapes are a little over half of them, so let’s say there are 700 tapes total. They’re all at least 30 minutes long and I know many went longer, so if I average say 40 minutes per tape, that’s 28,000 minutes or roughly 467 hours. I think the the transcribers for DASS averaged about 13 hours per 50 minutes of audio or so, but this audio is newer and I presume Utah transcribers will be more familiar with Utah speakers I think, so I’ll estimate 10 hours of work per tape. That’s 4670 hours of transcription. At $15 per hour, I’m looking at about $70,000 in student wages. Obviously, I can’t get that much coin internally so it sounds like this is only going to happen with an external grant.\nGrad student workers—That’s of course assuming that the only wages I’ll need to pay for are transcribers. This might be getting into “If you give a mouse a cookie” territory, but it would be nice to have some grad students helping out with the project. At UGA, we had at least four and as many as six grad students involved in the project at a time. There was a lot of overlap between our duties, but very roughly speaking, one managed the transcribers, one managed the spot-checks, one managed the acoustic analysis, and one did miscellaneous duties. We were all involved in analysis, and a few others popped in for a semester or two to do additional analysis or perform other duties. To lighten my load, it would be handy to have perhaps three grad students manage the transcribers, check their work, and do the acoustic analysis. I’m fuzzy on what costs are associated with RA-ships at BYU, but I do know it’ll add significantly to the total cost of the project.\nTime—How long will transcriptions take? I’ve done transcriptions and they’re soul-sucking work. Even when I was highly motivated to process my own dissertation data, that I collected myself, and under a bit of a time crunch, I could barely put in more than about two hours a day. I surely don’t expect undergraduate transcribers to do more than 10 hours a week. When motivated by money, I’ve seen some at UGA do more, but those students were exceptional. I’ll estimate five hours of work per transcriber per week. So under the assumption of 4670 hours of work total, that’s 934 transcriber-weeks. If a semester is fifteen weeks, that’s 62 transcriber-semesters. If I set a goal of getting all the work done in two years (six semesters if you include summers), it would take ten or eleven transcribers to do it in two years. Of course, these are all very rough estimates, but managing several tens of thousands of dollars and almost a dozen workers for two years is not something I expected to do right away!\nDigitizing—Regardless of the cost, number of workers, and time involved, the first step of the process will be digitization. Fortunately, it sounds like the Office of Digital Humanities can take care of that for me! Wow! So my short term goal is to get a batch—maybe 30 or 50 tapes—done first. While they work on digitizing the next batch, I can get started on listening to the first few minutes of the completed tapes and extracting whatever metadata I can from them. Eventually, all the tapes will be digitized and I can have a more concrete idea of how much audio (and consequently, people, time, hours, and money) I’m looking at.\nMetadata—After digitizing all of them, my next step will be to finish collecting the metadata. It’ll be nice to have a clear picture of birth years, genders, and birthplaces for all 700 or so people. The most likely scenario is that I won’t get an external grant because they’re extremely competitive, so I’ll have to prioritize which ones to transcribe first. The Historical Society would like to start with some of the prominent members of the community and descendants of the town’s founders. I’d like to find a balance of genders and birth years too, so we’ll probably settle on a subset that satisfies both of our needs. How big? I’m thinking between 35 and 70 (5% to 10% of the tapes). That’s a more reasonably-sized project that I could possibly get funded internally. It could provide me at least a beginning look at the speech community which would help seed an external grant.\nFollow-up project?—In case I just need more data to analyze (ha!) wouldn’t it be cool to track down some of the tapes that were given away? Presumably, if an ad in the paper is what it took for the families to get them, then an ad might be a good place to start to find them. We’d digitize the tapes right there for people, give them a copy and return the tape to them of course, but then also add that to the collection for the oral history. I think it would be especially cool to interview those people themselves! That way we can get some contemporary data to compare the tapes to, as well as track change within the family. That’ll have to wait until I get NSF grant number two!\nPublications—What’s the end goal? Well, I’ll obviously start cranking out some papers as soon as a reasonable amount of data has been processed. There is a lot going on in Utah English. Many of the stereotyped features are dying out, so these people may provide good acoustic data for what would otherwise be hard to study phonetically today. But there are also lots of other features that I believe are recent innovations, so if they’re infrequent or missing from these speakers, it’ll help establish the timing of when they did develop. Even before I had the tapes, I’ve been thinking a full analysis of this collection deserves a book-length treatment. It likely won’t get done before I’m up for tenure, but maybe it’ll go towards my application for full professor."

It’s so satisfying teaming up with a historical society and finding ways to help the community I’m studying too. Linguistically, they’re interesting to me for lots of reasons, but I think everyone benefits from seeing these tapes get processed. As far as how I’m going to go about processing all of them, I really have no idea what I’m doing so there will be a lot of learning involved. But I’m excited to be involved and to have a clear research trajectory for the next decade or so!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Here is a never-complete but growing description of my idiolect. I’ll add to it whenever I think of or discover new things about the way I speak English.\n\n\nI don’t like it when people say they don’t have an accent, however, my pronunciation is pretty close to what I’d call standard American English. I grew up in St. Charles County, Missouri, which is a suburb of St. Louis. You can read Matt Gordon and Chris Strelluf’s work for an in-depth analysis of Missouri English. See also Dan Duncan’s research which is focuses specifically on St. Charles County for an even closer match to my speech. My mom grew up in Minnesota and my dad grew up in Upstate New York and Minnesota.\n\n\n\nHere is a general look at my monophthongs. These come from a recording of me reading a bunch of real and nonce words where the vowel is flanked by coronals. (You can access this dataset with my joeysvowels package.)\n\nAs far as I can tell, I don’t have really any indication of any of the chain shifts that people are studying. Even though I grew up in the St. Louis Corridor, I don’t have the Northern Cities Shift. I also don’t have the Low-Back-Merger or the Low-Back-Merger Shift.\n\n\nMy lot and thought vowels are rather close phonetically but are definitely not merged. Lot is slightly fronter and unrounded while thought is slightly backer and rounded. They are very close to what Jonathan Dowse transcribes as [ɐ̞] and [ɒ̈] here.\nYou can read a fairly comprehensive list of words that I classify as lot and thought in Appendix C (pg. 209) of my dissertation, reproduced in a blog post here. On page 161, I explain that I have a clear intuition about which words are classified into which lexical set, though admittedly a few like probably, prom, mom, bronco, and pond could go either way.\nLike a lot of Americans even with the distinction, dog is thought, as are many other pre-/ɡ/ words. However, there are a few exceptions, like cog, which has an especially fronted vowel quality. Also, the name Og, as in the author Og Mandino, which is short for Augustine, bothers me because Og is clearly lot while Augustine is thought.\nPrelaterally, I have a conditioned merger, which is best described in Aaron Dinkin’s (2016) JEngL paper. (Aaron’s paper is based in Upstate New York, close to where my dad is from, so perhaps this is something I’ve gotten from him.) I have lot if the vowel is in an open syllable (and the following lateral is the onset of the following syllable), as in collar, dollar, anthropology, ollie, and trolley. In fact, I have a rather fronted vowel, fronter than my lot normally is. However, I have thought if the lateral is tautosyllabic, as in golf, dolphin, volume, and doll. Thus, words like doll & hall rhyme, while hollar & hauler and collar & caller do not. You can hear me pronounce these words in the video in this tweet.\nAs is typical of American English, the cloth lexical set is indistinguishable from my thought. Similarly, the palm set (and any “Foreign a” words; Boberg 2009) mostly fits in with my lot. Except, ironically, palm itself (as well as psalm, qualm, and alms), because of that /l/, which makes it part of thought.\nOne important phonological distinction between my lot and thought is that, even though Hayes (2009:82) says tenseness is not specified for low vowels, lot appears to be a lax vowel. Like other lax vowels, it doesn’t appear word-finally, except in marginal cases like ma and pa and in onomatopoeia (fa-la-la-la-la, haha, blah) and interjections (aha!, hurrah!). This means that some palm words like bra are reclassifed as thought. There are some exceptions though, like spa and schwa. So yes, for me, spa /spɑ/ and bra /bɹɔ/ don’t rhyme.\n\n\n\nI raise /æ/ before nasals. Before /n/ and /m/, it’s raised, fronted, and nasalized, such that ban is definitely not the same as bat or even bad. Before /ŋ/, it’s raised even higher to the point that naive me would classify the vowel in bang as /e/. In fact, I’m not actually 100% convinced that it even is /æ/ underlyingly; I may have rephonologized it as being truly /e/.\nAs I point out on page 74 of my dissertation, there are very few words with /ɛɡ/. A nearly complete list, as far as I know, is length, lengthen, strength, strengthen, penguin, dengue, and Bengal (tiger). For what it’s worth, those vowels are the same as /æŋ/, so that bang and the first syllable of Bengal are the same for me.\n\n\n\nAs I explain on page 400 of my 2022 American Speech paper on prevelar raising, I raise historic /ɛɡ/ to something like [eɪɡ] such that beg, egg, leg, and Greg all rhyme with vague. It happens in open syllables like in legacy, negative, and megaphone. It occurs in some infrequent words like renege. I’ve also got it when the vowel has secondary stress, like in Winnipeg, stegosaurus, and nutmeg.\nHowever, there are a handful of exceptions, which was a major part of the reason why I did that paper in the first place. For an unclear reason to me, integrity, segregate, interregnum, and segment all have [ɛ]. I noticed that the /ɡ/ in those words are all followed by sonorants, but that’s not a guarantee blocker of raising since regulate, pregnant, and segue are raised. Interestingly, negligible is raised but negligent is not. Also, peg is raised but JPEG is not. Finally, any word with &lt;x&gt; pronounced as [ɡz] (yes, it’s voiced for me) like exit, exile, excerpt, and exigence are firmly [ɛ] and not [e].\n\n\n\nI don’t know the technical term for this, but I have two, possibly three, unstressed vowels, such that Rosa’s and roses aren’t homophonous to me. The first has [ə] while the second is what I’d transcribe as [ɨ].\nMy [ɨ] category of words is rather large and I have it in a handful of environments. Some of the distribution is predictable. I have [ɨ] in plurals (classes, offices), 3rd person singular (loses, pushes), and past tense allomorphs (waited, decided). Word-finally, it’s always [ə], as in extra, area, and data.\nIn a lot of words, I think I’m influenced by spelling. Word-initially, if it’s spelled with an &lt;a&gt;, &lt;o&gt;, &lt;u&gt; I have [ə], as in again, among, & ago, occur, opinion & obtain, and upon, unless, & until. (This spelling preference might explain why I always have [ə] word-finally because as far as I can tell &lt;a&gt; is the only letter used for unstressed word-final vowels.) However, if it’s an &lt;e&gt;, then I have [ɨ], as in expect, edition, effect, emotion, event, and exactly.\nWord-internally though, I haven’t done enough digging to see if there are any patterns and I’m not familiar with the literature so I don’t know what to look out for. I have a suspicion that if it’s next to a coronal sound, the vowel is [ɨ] and [ə] otherwise. So I have [ɨ] in student, woman, & happen but [ə] in problem, system, & item. I have [ɨ] in minute, private, & unit, but [ə] in product, democrat, develop, proposal. Interestingly, I have both vowels in advocate [ˈædvəkɨt]. But there are exceptions to these generalizations, like stomach, perfect, galaxy, miracle, and obstacle all have [ɨ]. I have [ɨ] in regime but [ə] in machine, which makes me think spelling is a stronger factor than phonological context. Without being too exhaustive, I’m inclined to think that [ɨ] is the elsewhere allophone and that [ə] is the exception.\nAs for a possible third one, I have some [ʊ]-like vowel in words like success, support, and suggest. It seems like word-initial &lt;su&gt; might be the environment, but I also get it in to. I’ll have to dig a little deeper to think of other examples.\n\n\n\nI have lost the ability to intuit what’s going on with my back vowels before laterals, but I’ll try to explain what I think I have. I know I merge /ʊl/ with /ol/, so that pull and pole are homophonous. However, it’s the /ʌl/ class that is really tricky for me. When it’s in a closed syllable, like in hull, dull, cull, and mulch, I’m pretty sure I at least had it merged with /ol/. However, I’ve looked at the list of words so much and I’ve thought about this enough that I pretty much know all the words that fall into this category without thinking (at least the one-syllable words) and I apparently want to unmerge them, so now you’ll be hard pressed to find me saying hull the same as hole, even in casual situations. Words like culture, result, vulnerable, multuple, and ultimately, I have no idea what I do.\nIn fact, it was this homophone that got me interested in prelaterals in the first place! There is a small town near the University of Georgia named Hull, and I had to go there for something. I thought to myself over and over as a I drove there, “Wait, is this pronounced like Hole?” I never did really figure out what I did.\nHowever, when it’s in an open syllable, like color, gullet, and sculley. The word adult fits in this category as being firmly [ʌ] rather than [o]. Though not all open syllable words are [ʌ] because like gully and mulligan I think I said as [o] when I was younger. (Not sure what I do now.) A word like sullen could go either way, even now.\n\n\n\n\nHere are a list of some of my favorite things I have in my idiolect.\n\nI epenthesize a [k] in ancient, [ẽɪ̃ŋkʃɨnt]. I think what’s going on is I have [ŋ] instead of [n] in the first syllable, possibly analogous to anxious, and the [k] slips in there as I transition from the velar nasal to the post-alveolar fricative.\nbig has a bit of raising towards the end of the vowel. I’d transcribe it as [bɪi̯ɡ]. I don’t have it in any other /ɪɡ/ word, as far as I know, not even pig.\nwant is [wʌnt]. In other words wants is homophonous with once.\nI 100% say camouflague as “camel-flague”. So I have an extra /l/ in there.\nThe last syllable of kindergarten has a /d/ underlyingly rather than /t/.\nThe default way I say grandma is [ɡɹæ̃mə].\n\n ## Other things\n\n\n\n/t/ and /d/ before /ɹ/ (as in try, train, dry, and drain) are affricated to [tʃɹ] and [dʒɹ]. In other words, little kid me would spell them as “chry” and “jrain”.\nI raise /æ/ before nasals but not in other environments.\n\n\n\n\n\nI pronounce the &lt;l&gt; in words like psalm, alm, palm, qualm. I also pronounce it in wolf, yolk, and folk. I know I used to insert an [ɫ] in both and local, but I don’t think I do that anymore. I do do it in only though.\nThe second syllable of caterpiller doesn’t have an /ɹ/ underlyingly: /kætəpɪlɚ/\nlair is homophonous with layer and does not rhyme with hair.\nI don’t pronounce the &lt;t&gt; in often.\nThough both my parents grew up north of the on line and therefore have lot in on, I don’t, so on is firmly thought.\nI don’t have the pin-pen merger, but I have /ɪ/ in parentheses and /ɛ/ in symmetry.\nI consistently say settler with three syllables ([sɛ.ɾl̩.ɚ]) and not two (*[sɛʔ.lɚ]), even when saying the name of the game Settlers of Catan.\nI think I say violet with two syllables, meaning it’s [ˈvɑɪ.lɨt] instead of [ˈvɑɪ.ə.lət]. However, alveolar does have a very short schwa, so it’s [æɫˈvi.ə.lɚ], which does not rhyme with velar [ˈvi.lɚ].\n\n\n\n\n\nSince my kids are growing up in an area different from where I grew up, they will likely acquire a different variety of English from my own. Here’s a list of things I’ve heard my 6-year-old say that is different from my own speech.\n\nkindergarten has a clear [t], i.e [kʰɨndɚɡɑɹtʰɨn] while I definitely have an underlying /d/ there.\nOccasional use of [ʔɨn] in words like Martin"

    "text": "In grad school I offered workshops on a variety of topics relating to R between Fall 2017 and Spring 2020. They were held Fridays at 3:30 in the DigiLab at the UGA Main Library. Videos for some of these are available here. Below you will find materials for these workshops. I hope they are thorough enough that you can make use of them as stand-alone documents.\nThe data used in these workshops can be found at my datasets page.\nIf you are planning on attending a workshop in the near future, please see the setup instructions to help you get R and RStudio installed on your computer.\nNote: If you attended these workshops, please consider giving me some feedback with this anonymous survey so I can know how to improve.\n\n\n\nIn this first workshop I cover the basics of R itself. I talk about the differences between R and RStudio and I help folks get both installed and running on their computers. We create a simple “Hello, World!” script using R. Part 2 covers the basics of the R language. It is also be a very simple introduction to some core computer coding concepts like declaring variables and variable types.\nAdditional Materials: You may also be interested in a PDF of the slides I used in Part 1 or a PDF version of Part 2’s handout. An older version that combines elements of both parts can be found here as a PDF or RMarkdown file.\n\n\n\n\nggplot2 is a widely used package that allows for high-quality visualizations. These workshops take you from installation to pretty advanced topics.\n\n\nIn Part 1 of this workshop I cover the basic syntax and how to make some simple types of plots.\n\n\n\nOften you’ll want to customize your plots in some way. So, in Part 2, we cover how to mess with properties of the plots like the axes, colors, and legends to make the plot work better for you.\n\n\n\nApparently I had a lot to say about how to extend your ggplot2 skills, so I ended up creating a supplement with lots of additional detail on how to modify your plots. This handout will vary from time to time as I add to it when I learn new things or remove sections to incorporate them into future workshops.\n\n\n\nBased on a popular blog post I wrote, this workshop wraps all customization methods together and shows how to create your own themes.\n\n\n\nAs I was preparing for the custom themes workshop, I got a little carried away illustrating all the components of the theme function. I decided to simplify that portion of the workshop and create this separate handout that just focuses on theme. It is not yet finished, but it may be of some help to people (including myself!).\nAdditional Materials: You may also be interested in the 2018 versions of some of these workshops that I gave (Part 1 Rmarkdown and PDF and Part 2 RMarkdown and PDF). An older version from 2017 that combines elements of Parts 1 and 2 can be found here as a PDF or RMarkdown file.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse is a suite of packages that includes dplyr and tidyr which help you wrangle your data. In this two-part workshop, we learn some of the common functions in the tidyverse and compare them to base R, showing that there are multiple ways to accomplish the same task in R. Part 2 in particular looks at how to reshape and transform your data, merging it with other dataset, and other super useful and powerful tools.\nAdditional Materials: You may also be interested in PDFs for Part 1 and Part 2. An older version that combines elements of both parts can be found here as a PDF or RMarkdown file.\n\n\n\n\nR Markdown is a way to create different types of documents using R (pdfs, word files, html files). In this one-day crash course, I show how to make R Markdown files and the kinds of things they would be useful for.\nAdditional Materials: If you’d rather use a PDF of the workshop materials, there’s one available here.\n\n\n\n\nShiny is an R package that allows you to make your own interactive web pages. An entire semester could be devoted to Shiny and there’s a bit of a learning curve, especially if you haven’t used HTML before. This two-day workshop covers just the essentials.\nNote that the materials for this workshop include interactive shiny elements, which means I can’t host them on my own website. So instead, they’re hosted on Shiny’s free server space. But this comes with a major drawback: they’re only available for 25 user-hours a month.

I have included PDFs and additional information on each installment of this series.\n\n\n\nThis tutorial walks you through writing a praat script that extracts formant measurements from vowels. If you’ve never worked with Praat scripting but want to work with vowels, this might be a good starting point.\n\n\n\nThis is a multi-part tutorial on how to make sort of the typical vowel plots in R. Part 1 shows plotting single-point measurements as scatter plots and serves as a mild introduction to ggplot2. Part 2 shows how to plot trajectories, both in the F1-F2 space and in a Praat-like time-Hz space, and is a bit of an introduction to tidyverse as well.\n\n\n\nThis is a two-part tutorial on calculating Pillai scores and Bhattacharyya’s Affinity in R. The first covers what I consider the bare necessities, culminating custom R functions for each. The second is a bit more in-depth as it looks at ways to make the functions more robust, but it also shows some simple visualizations you can make with the output.\n\n\n\nI’m no expert, but I have given a workshop on how grad students can increase their online presence and make themselves more googleable, based in large part to ImpactStory’s fantastic 30-day challenge, which you can read here.\n\n\n\nIn response to the need for a “How to Make an Academic Poster” workshop, I put one together last minute. Poster-making is more of an art than a science and this is a very opinionated view on the dos and don’ts of making an academic poster.\n\n\n\nI once gave a workshop on Excel and ended producing a long handout, that goes from the very basics to relatively tricky techniques.

It covers data prep, basic plots, visualizing statistical models, maps, and a whole bunch of other stuff.\nFundamentals of Data Visualization by Claus O. Wilke is “meant as a guide to making visualizations that accurately reflect the data, tell a story, and look professional.”\nInteractive web-based data visualization with R, plotly, and shiny by Carson Sievert is another free online book on data visualization in in R. This has a good focus on interactivity since it involves plotly and Shiny.\nMastering Shiny by Hadley Wickham is under development and will be released late 2020. I’m looking forward to this comprehensive book on Winston Chang’s shiny package a lot actually, but in the meantime though you and I can peruse the online version for free.\n\n\n\n\nI’ve given a workshop on colors in data visualization, which you can view here. In it, I list the following resources, plus a whole bunch of other ones.\n\n\n\nYour Friendly Guide to Colors in Data Visualisation by Lisa Charlotte Rost is a great overview of using colors in data visualization with lots of links to other sites and resources.\nWhat to consider when choosing colors for data visualization by Lisa Charlotte Rost has great brief tips for color in data visualization. Be sure to see the links at the bottom for more resources!\nWhen you do create your own palettes, be sure to run it through this Color Blindness Simulator to make sure that everyone can see them. Nick Tierney’s blog post also walks you through a way to check this in R.\nStephen Few has a nice guide for using colors and has his own palette you can use.\nMasataka Okabe and Kei Ito have a guide called Color Universal Design that is pretty well-known.\nFabio Crameri, Grace E. Shephard & Philip J. Heron’s article in Nature called The misuse of colour in science communication may help you when choosing a color palette.\n\n\n\n\n\nA monster compilation of color palettes in R can be found at Emil Hvitfeldt’s Github.\nThe scico package has a bunch of colorblind-safe, perceptually uniform, ggplot2-friendly color palettes for use in visuals. Very cool.\nThe color brewer website, while best for maps, offers great color palettes that are colorblind and sometimes also printer-safe.

Sometimes you want to add a bit of pizzazz to your presentation, but other times animation really is the best way to visualize something. Either way, this package will help you out a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitely check out Tyler Morgan-Wall’s rayshader package. It makes it pretty simple to make absolutely stunning 3D images of your data in R. You can make 3D maps if you have spatial data, but you can also turn any boring ggplot2 plot into a 3D work of art. Seriously, go try it out.\nLego World Map - Rayshader Walkthrough by Arthur Welle is an awesome walkthrough on rayshader and maps made out of virtual Legos. It’s a lot of fun.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdward Tufte is a statistician known for his series of four books that focus on best practices in the presentation of data: The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, Envisioning Information, Visual Explanations, and Beautiful Evidence. I read them over several months on the bus and they are very cool. As a practical application of them, this page by Lukasz Piwek shows how to implement many of these visualizations in R. You can also use ggthemes to get some of this implementation.\nJoey Cherdarchuk of Darkhorse Analytics has put together some really succinct presentations on how to simplify things you might put in a paper like maps, charts, tables, and reducing the data to ink ratio.\nClaus Wilke’s Practical ggplot2 is a “repository [that] houses a set of step-by-step examples demonstrating how to get the most out of ggplot2, including how to choose and customize scales, how to theme plots, and when and how to use extension packages.”\nMalcom Barrett’s Designing ggplots: Making clear figures that communicate is a great walk-through, with code, on how to really make your plots look professional, with emphasis on telling a story.\nThe Glamour of Graphics, a talk at RStudio::Conf 2020 by William Chase that discusses how to make nice-looking plots.\nA ggplot2 Tutorial for Beautiful Plotting in R by Cédric Scherer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe R Graph Gallery has hundreds of plots, with code, illustrating what the plots are typically used for and different variants of the same plot.

In March of 2019, they followed up with a monster 43-article special issue, Statistical Inference in the 21st Century: A World Beyond p &lt; 0.05, wherein they recommend that the expression “statistically significant” be abandoned. This has potential to be a pivot point in the field of statistics. Why should a linguist care? Well, the first article in that issue says “If you use statistics in research, business, or policymaking but are not a statistician, these articles were indeed written with YOU in mind.” If you use statistics in your research, it might be worth reading through at least the first article of this issue.\nThe book Modern Dive: An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R by Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim is a free eBook available that teachest the basics of R and statistics. See Andrew Heiss’s post about this book for more information.\nSame Stats, Different Graphs: Generating Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing by Justin Matejka and George Fitzmaurice. This went viral in some circles and shows that you can get the exact same summary statistics with wildly different distributions. Very cool.\nHere’s a BuzzFeed article by Stephanie M. Lee about a researcher who made the news because of his unbelieveable amount of p-hacking and using “statistics” to lie about his data.\nHave you learned about tests like t-tests, ANOVA, chi-squared tests? Did you know they’re all just reguression under the hood? Check out this explanation by Jonas Kristoffer Lindeløv called Common statistical tests are linear models. It’s mathy and based in R.\n\n\n\n\n\nBodo Winter’s mixed-effects modeling tutorials are the best resource I’ve found on using these in linguistics research. It’s a two-part tutorial, so be sure to look through both of them.\nMixed-Effects Regression Models in Linguistics, edited by Dirk Speelman, Kris Heylen, & Dirk Geeraerts and published by Springer is an entire book on mixed-effects models, specifically for linguists.\nMichael Clark’s post called Shrinkage in Mixed Effects Models has some beautiful illustrations that demonstrate shirnkage. In fact, he has written a much larger document explaining what mixed-effects models and how to run them in R.\nMixed Modeling as a Foreign Language, a blog post by Andrew McDonald, first off is a good explanation of what mixed modeling is all about. But more importantly, it makes the point that “if you only partly understand the words you are using, you will humiliate yourself eventually.” In other words, it’s important to know what you’re doing when you use statistics, and if you don’t, maybe you should reconsider before you do something wrong.\nReference Collection to push back against “Common Statistical Myths” is a crowdsourced compilation (managed by Andrew Althouse) of articles that may be used to argue against some common statistical myths or no-nos.\nLisa M.

The PDF can be found here but don’t forget to look at the page it comes from which has more information about it.\nPhonetics on Speed: Praat Scripting Tutorial by Jörg Mayer is what I find myself coming back to again and again.\nSpeCT - The Speech Corpus Toolkit for Praat is a collection of well-documented Praat scripts written by Mietta Lennes. I often find my way to this page when I need help for a specific task in Praat and incorporate some of the code in these scripts into my own.\nUniversity of Washington Phonetics Lab has a bunch of tutorials and scripts.\nMichelle Cohn has written and posted a bunch of very useful Praat scripts that you can download and use.\nA YouTube channel called ListenLab by Watt Winn that has a bunch of video tutorials on how to do stuff in Praat.\nAnother YouTube channel called Intro to Speech Acoustics that may be useful to students of acoustics, phonetics, etc.\nAnd I’ve written a tutorial on writing a script for basic automatic formant extraction.\n\n ## Working with audio\nThere are three main steps for processing audio: transcription, forced alignment, and formant extraction.\n\n\nThere is software available that you can use to transcribe in like Praat, Transcriber, and ELAN. But here are some tools I’ve seen that do automatic transcription.\n\nCLOx is a new automatic transcriber available from the University of Washington. It’s a web-based service that uses Microsoft Bing’s Speech Recognition system to transcribe your audio. It’s estimated that a sociolinguistic interview can be transcribed in a fifth the time as a manual transcription. The great news is that it’s available for several languages!\nDARLA is actually a whole collection of tools available through a web interface from Dartmouth University. It can transcribe, align, and extract formants from your (English) audio files all in one go. For automatic transcription, you can use their own in-house system by using the “Completely Automated” method. They admit the transcriptions won’t be perfect, but they provide a handy tool for manual correcting.\nOH-Portal is by the Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing. It works on several languages, and on clean lab data, it’s a little faster to run this and correct the transcription than it is to do a transcription from scratch. Runs entirely through the web browser, so you don’t have to download anything.\n\n\n\n\nI’ve got a lot of audio that I need to process, so a crucial part of all that is force aligning the text to the audio. Smart people have come up with free software to do this. Here’s a list of the ones I’ve seen.\n\nDARLA, avilable from Dartmouth University, is the one I’ve used the most. It can transcribe, align, and extract formants from your (English) audio files all in one go. Previously, its forced aligner is built using Prosody-Lab but now uses the Montreal Forced Aligner (see below).\nThe Montreal Forced Aligner is a relatively new one that I heard about for the first time at the 2017 LSA conference. It is fundamentally different than other ones in that it uses a software called Kaldi. It’s easy to set up and install and I’ve used it on my own data. The benefit of this over DARLA is that it’s on your own computer so you don’t have to wait for files to upload. And you can process files in bulk. Be sure to check out Michael McAuliffe’s blog on updates.\nFAVE is probably the most well-known forced aligner. It’s open source and you can download it on your own computer from Joe Fruehwald’s Github page. Or if you’d prefer, you can UPenn’s their web interface instead.\nProsodylab-Aligner is, according to their website, “a set of Python and shell scripts for performing automated alignment of text to audio of speech using Hidden Markov Models.” This is a software available through McGill University that actually allows you to train your own acoustic model (e.g. on a non-English audio corpus). I haven’t used it yet, but if I ever need to process non-English audio, this’ll be my go-to.\nSPPAS is a software package with several functions including forced alignment in several languages. Of the aligners you can download to your computer, this might be one of the easier ones to use.\nWebMAUS is another web interface with multiple functions including a forced aligner for several languages.\nGentle advertises itself as a “robust yet lenient forced aligner built on Kaldi.” It’s easy to download and use and produces what appear to be very good word-level alignments of a provided transcript. It even ignored the interviewer’s voice in the file I tried. The output is a .csv file, so I’m not sure how to turn that into a TextGrid, and if you need phoneme-level acoustic measurements, a word-level transcription isn’t going to work.\n\n\n\n\n\nSantiago Barreda’s Fast Track is my current go-to tool for automated formant extraction. It’s a Praat plug-in, but it works really well with the accompanying R package, FastTrackR. Give them both a try!\nFAVE-Extract is the standard that tons of people use.\nPolyglotDB works well with large, force-aligned corpora.\nIf you want to do write a script yourself, I’ve written a tutorial on writing a script for basic automatic formant extraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rtMRI IPA chart has MRI videos of all the sounds on the IPA chart.\nJonathan Dowse’s IPA Charts with Audio includes basically any possible combination of co-articulatations, regardless of whether they’re actually attested in human language.\nIPA Phonetics is an iPhone app has what they call an “elaborated” IPA chart with lots of extra places and manners of articulation, complete with audio clips of all the sounds. You can play a game where it’ll play a sound and you can guess what you heard. It’s just fun to see things like a voiced uvular fricative (ɢʁ) or a dentolabial fricative [θ̼] on an IPA chart. Credits to University of Victoria linguistics and John Esling’s “Phonetic Notation” (chapter 18 of the Handbook of Phonetic Sciences, 2nd ed.).\nPink Trombone is an interesting site that has a interactive simulator of the vocal tract. You can click around and make different vowels and consonants. Pretty fun resource for teaching how speech works.\n\n\n\n\n\nI enjoy reading and attempting to implement good typography into my website. Here are some resources that I have found helpful for that.\n\n\nI designed this website more or less from scratch, so I can appreciate the work others put into their own academic sites. Here are some examples of beautiful websites that I have found that I really like.\n\nKieran Healy has one of the beautiful academic websites I’ve ever seen. I created this category on this page just so I could include his page on here. Wow.\nPractical Typography by Matthew Butterick is was my gateway into typography. My font selection and many other little details on my site (slides, posters, CV, etc.) were influenced by this book.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you enjoy the work of Edward Tufte and would like to incorporate some of his design principles into your website, you’ll be interested in Tufte CSS by Dave Liepmann. If you’re interested in your RMarkdown files rendering in a Tufte-style (like this), there are ways to do that too, which you can read in chapter 3 of bookdown by Yihui Xie or chapter 6 of R Markdown, by Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund (cf. this).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccasionally, I’ll see posts with really good and insightful tips on how to be an academic. For the ones I saw I Twitter, I’ve put the first post here: click on them to go directly to that tweet where you can read the rest.\n\nHow to make effective slides by Kieran Healy.\nAdvice to a young scholar by Kensy Kooperrider.\nHere’s a page with a Q&A and lots of links to pages about what it’s like going into grad school in linguistics, written by Joshua Raclaw.\nTwitter for Scientists by Daniel S.

Zotero is a fantastic tool for, well, collecting, organizing, and citing scientific literature and I’m not exaggerating when I say that I could not be in academics without it.\nVulgar: A Language Generator is a site that automatically creates a new conlang, based on parameters that you specify. The free web version allows you to add whatever vowels and consonants you’d like to include, and it’ll create a full language: a language name; IPA chart for vowels and consonants; phonotactics; phonological rules; and paradigms for nominal morphology, definite and indefinite articles, personal pronouns, and verb conjugations; derivational morphology; and a lexicon of over 200 words. For $19 you can download the software and get a lexicon of 2000 words, derivational words, random semantic overlaps with natural languages, and the ability to customize orthography, syllable structure, and phonological rules. In addition to just being kinda fun, this is a super useful resource for creating homework assignments for students.\nThe EMU-webApp “is a fully fledged browser-based labeling and correction tool that offers a multitude of labeling and visualization features.” I haven’t given this enough time to learn to use it properly, but it seems very helpful.\nJonhannes Haushofer’s CV of Failures. Other people have written this more elegantly than I could, but sometimes it’s nice to see that other academics fail too. You’re not going to get into all the conferences you apply for, your papers are sometimes going to be rejected, and you’re definitely not getting all the funding you apply for. I find it therapeutic to put together a CV of failures like his researcher did and to keep it updated and formatted just as would a regular CV. Don’t let impostor syndrome get in the way by thinking others haven’t failed too.\nKieran Healey’s The Plain Person’s Guide to Plain Text Social Science is an entire book on an aspect of productivity that I’ve only thought about occasionally: what kind of software should you do your work? Before you get too entrenched in your workflow, it’s good to consider what your options are.\nThisWordDoesNotExist.com is a fun site created by Thomas Dimson."

I have included PDFs and additional information on each installment of this series.\n\n\n\nThis tutorial walks you through writing a praat script that extracts formant measurements from vowels. If you’ve never worked with Praat scripting but want to work with vowels, this might be a good starting point.\n\n\n\nThis is a multi-part tutorial on how to make sort of the typical vowel plots in R. Part 1 shows plotting single-point measurements as scatter plots and serves as a mild introduction to ggplot2. Part 2 shows how to plot trajectories, both in the F1-F2 space and in a Praat-like time-Hz space, and is a bit of an introduction to tidyverse as well.\n\n\n\nThis is a two-part tutorial on calculating Pillai scores and Bhattacharyya’s Affinity in R. The first covers what I consider the bare necessities, culminating custom R functions for each. The second is a bit more in-depth as it looks at ways to make the functions more robust, but it also shows some simple visualizations you can make with the output.\n\n\n\nI’m no expert, but I have given a workshop on how grad students can increase their online presence and make themselves more googleable, based in large part to ImpactStory’s fantastic 30-day challenge, which you can read here.\n\n\n\nIn response to the need for a “How to Make an Academic Poster” workshop, I put one together last minute. Poster-making is more of an art than a science and this is a very opinionated view on the dos and don’ts of making an academic poster.\n\n\n\nI once gave a workshop on Excel and ended producing a long handout, that goes from the very basics to relatively tricky techniques.

I read them over several months on the bus and they are very cool. As a practical application of them, this page by Lukasz Piwek shows how to implement many of these visualizations in R. You can also use ggthemes to get some of this implementation.\nJoey Cherdarchuk of Darkhorse Analytics has put together some really succinct presentations on how to simplify things you might put in a paper like maps, charts, tables, and reducing the data to ink ratio.\nClaus Wilke’s Practical ggplot2 is a “repository [that] houses a set of step-by-step examples demonstrating how to get the most out of ggplot2, including how to choose and customize scales, how to theme plots, and when and how to use extension packages.”\nMalcom Barrett’s Designing ggplots: Making clear figures that communicate is a great walk-through, with code, on how to really make your plots look professional, with emphasis on telling a story.\nThe Glamour of Graphics, a talk at RStudio::Conf 2020 by William Chase that discusses how to make nice-looking plots.\nA ggplot2 Tutorial for Beautiful Plotting in R by Cédric Scherer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe R Graph Gallery has hundreds of plots, with code, illustrating what the plots are typically used for and different variants of the same plot. Very cool.\nMy friend Andres Karjus has given several workshops on wide range of data visualization topics, collectively called aRt of the figure: explore and visualize your data using R. You should definitely explore his github and check out his materials.\nThis blog post by Jesse Sadler is a great tutorial on how to use R to visualize network data.\nPlotting special characters or unique fonts can be tricky. Yixuan Qiu’s tutorial showtext: Using Fonts More Easily in R Graphs can help you with that.\nGeorge Bailey’s excelent workshop materials for visualizing vowel formant data can be found here.\nNot sure what kind of data visualization you should use, try From Data to Viz to help you find the most appropriate plot for your data."

In March of 2019, they followed up with a monster 43-article special issue, Statistical Inference in the 21st Century: A World Beyond p &lt; 0.05, wherein they recommend that the expression “statistically significant” be abandoned. This has potential to be a pivot point in the field of statistics. Why should a linguist care?

    "text": "Will Styler’s Praat tutorial is probably the most thorough I’ve seen. The PDF can be found here but don’t forget to look at the page it comes from which has more information about it.\nPhonetics on Speed: Praat Scripting Tutorial by Jörg Mayer is what I find myself coming back to again and again.\nSpeCT - The Speech Corpus Toolkit for Praat is a collection of well-documented Praat scripts written by Mietta Lennes. I often find my way to this page when I need help for a specific task in Praat and incorporate some of the code in these scripts into my own.\nUniversity of Washington Phonetics Lab has a bunch of tutorials and scripts.\nMichelle Cohn has written and posted a bunch of very useful Praat scripts that you can download and use.\nA YouTube channel called ListenLab by Watt Winn that has a bunch of video tutorials on how to do stuff in Praat.\nAnother YouTube channel called Intro to Speech Acoustics that may be useful to students of acoustics, phonetics, etc.\nAnd I’ve written a tutorial on writing a script for basic automatic formant extraction.\n\n ## Working with audio\nThere are three main steps for processing audio: transcription, forced alignment, and formant extraction.\n\n\nThere is software available that you can use to transcribe in like Praat, Transcriber, and ELAN. But here are some tools I’ve seen that do automatic transcription.\n\nCLOx is a new automatic transcriber available from the University of Washington. It’s a web-based service that uses Microsoft Bing’s Speech Recognition system to transcribe your audio. It’s estimated that a sociolinguistic interview can be transcribed in a fifth the time as a manual transcription. The great news is that it’s available for several languages!\nDARLA is actually a whole collection of tools available through a web interface from Dartmouth University. It can transcribe, align, and extract formants from your (English) audio files all in one go. For automatic transcription, you can use their own in-house system by using the “Completely Automated” method. They admit the transcriptions won’t be perfect, but they provide a handy tool for manual correcting.\nOH-Portal is by the Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing. It works on several languages, and on clean lab data, it’s a little faster to run this and correct the transcription than it is to do a transcription from scratch. Runs entirely through the web browser, so you don’t have to download anything.\n\n\n\n\nI’ve got a lot of audio that I need to process, so a crucial part of all that is force aligning the text to the audio. Smart people have come up with free software to do this. Here’s a list of the ones I’ve seen.\n\nDARLA, avilable from Dartmouth University, is the one I’ve used the most. It can transcribe, align, and extract formants from your (English) audio files all in one go. Previously, its forced aligner is built using Prosody-Lab but now uses the Montreal Forced Aligner (see below).\nThe Montreal Forced Aligner is a relatively new one that I heard about for the first time at the 2017 LSA conference. It is fundamentally different than other ones in that it uses a software called Kaldi. It’s easy to set up and install and I’ve used it on my own data. The benefit of this over DARLA is that it’s on your own computer so you don’t have to wait for files to upload. And you can process files in bulk. Be sure to check out Michael McAuliffe’s blog on updates.\nFAVE is probably the most well-known forced aligner. It’s open source and you can download it on your own computer from Joe Fruehwald’s Github page. Or if you’d prefer, you can UPenn’s their web interface instead.\nProsodylab-Aligner is, according to their website, “a set of Python and shell scripts for performing automated alignment of text to audio of speech using Hidden Markov Models.” This is a software available through McGill University that actually allows you to train your own acoustic model (e.g. on a non-English audio corpus). I haven’t used it yet, but if I ever need to process non-English audio, this’ll be my go-to.\nSPPAS is a software package with several functions including forced alignment in several languages. Of the aligners you can download to your computer, this might be one of the easier ones to use.\nWebMAUS is another web interface with multiple functions including a forced aligner for several languages.\nGentle advertises itself as a “robust yet lenient forced aligner built on Kaldi.” It’s easy to download and use and produces what appear to be very good word-level alignments of a provided transcript. It even ignored the interviewer’s voice in the file I tried. The output is a .csv file, so I’m not sure how to turn that into a TextGrid, and if you need phoneme-level acoustic measurements, a word-level transcription isn’t going to work.\n\n\n\n\n\nSantiago Barreda’s Fast Track is my current go-to tool for automated formant extraction. It’s a Praat plug-in, but it works really well with the accompanying R package, FastTrackR. Give them both a try!\nFAVE-Extract is the standard that tons of people use.\nPolyglotDB works well with large, force-aligned corpora.\nIf you want to do write a script yourself, I’ve written a tutorial on writing a script for basic automatic formant extraction."

It’s a fun little gig where I get to do presentations, workshops, and seminars on digital humanities, in addition to helping researchers one-on-one on their own projects.\nI’ve always been fairly tech savvy in my research. I minored in Linguistic Computing and had a job as an undergrad creating eBooks. I’ve always been fairly quantitative about things too, and I went over to the stats department last year and took classes on linear regression and multivariate analysis.\nThis week is my first presentation where I’ll show how to extract data from primary sources, introduce people to spreadsheets, and showcase JMP. If you’ve never heard of it, JMP (pronounced “jump”) is a pretty sophisticated piece of statistical software that can do all sorts of statistical analyses and visualizations. The great part is it’s drag-and-drop interface. No coding means it’s great for beginners.\nI’ll be the first to admit that JMPs visualizations (at least as well as I can make them) are not as good as what I can do with ggplot2 in R. But I do like how easy it is to make quick and dirty visualizations in JMP. For this reason, it’s usually my go-to when exploring a new dataset. With just a few clicks, it makes it really easy to get to know your data visually as well as what’s under the hood.\nAs far as I know, JMP is not widely used in Linguistics or even in the Humanities, so showcasing it will be a lot of fun to people this week. I still think that everyone should learn R for their research, but since coding can be intimidating, JMP is a great tool for researchers wanting to get more quantitative about their projects.\nUpdate (October 7): I just finished the presentation. I had about a dozen people in attendance, and I was the youngest person in the room. And besides the one other grad student there, I was probably the only one without a Ph.D. But, I feel like it went well. Not to mention, it was the first time I was introduced before a presentation, and there was food!"
