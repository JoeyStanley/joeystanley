<p>On Friday morning, I presented on a talk called “Towards a taxonomy of meta-linguistic commentary: The case of Utah English.” I’m venturing out into qualitative data analysis because the comments I hear about Utah English are juicy! The gist is that the vibes I get from Utahns about their own variety are different than the vibes I get from others about their varieties. So, is there a way to quantify this abstract part of language regard? I’m not there yet, but I show a few categories of comments that seem to be common in Utah. Perhaps I can soon start to quantify things and put a number on those different vibes.</p>

<p>At the ADS poster session, Scott Kiesling had a poster called “Measuring Pittsburgh Neighborhoods with the Archive of Pittsburgh Language and Speech (APLS)”. Scott was involved in data collection in Pittsburgh in the early 2000s and recently, Dan Villarreal created <a href="https://apls.pitt.edu">APLS</a> to make it easy to search and work with that data. We test whether a dozen or so phonological variables are conditioned by neighborhood. We do find some evidence and we can see how these variables co-occur. This is my first time venturing into this dialect area, so it’s pretty exciting to me to work with this new (to me) dataset!</p>

<p>Recently, several of us in the linguistics department at BYU started a group called the <strong>Coalition Against Linguistic Discrimination</strong> (CALD). It has been on my mind for a while now that I want to make a difference in the world when it comes to linguistic discrimination, accentism, and linguistic prejudice. We are now a group of faculty and students trying to find ways to raise awareness across campus and do research on this topic.</p>
<p>One of our first products is a poster presentation at BYU’s <a href="https://forthebenefitoftheworld.byu.edu">For the Benefit of the World</a> conference. This conference is an “effort to explore the state of BYU research and creative works associated with caring for those in need, including work that addresses existing human needs or their root causes and scholarship related to humanitarian efforts of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.” From the looks of it, they probably expected abstracts related to medicine, water sanitation, or other clearly humanitarian-based projects. They probably didn’t expect a linguistics-based presentation—which is the very reason we wanted to submit.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was unable to attend because of a conflict in my teaching schedule. But Dr.&nbsp;Lisa Morgan Johnson presented on behalf of the group. She also did the lion’s share of preparing the poster as well. As part of this presentation, we’ve prepared a page of <a href="../../pages/linguistic-discrimination.html">resources for learning more about linguistic discrimination</a>. Hopefully this is the beginning of full-fledged website, but for now we just wanted <em>something</em> to send conference attendees to for more information.</p>

<p>This week, I’m in Ann Arbor, Michigan at the New Ways of Analyzing Variation 53 conference! On Friday I gave a talk on the <em>cord-card</em> merger in Utah, based on the <a href="../../blog/kohler-tapes-update3">Kohler Tapes</a> data.</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-tip callout-titled">

</div>
</div>
<p>This is especially exciting for me because it’s one of the first times I’ve presented concrete results from my <a href="../../blog/kohler-tapes">Kohler Tapes</a>. This is a collection of cassette tapes containing audio of eighth graders interviewing older community members, who were often their grandparents. This took place in Heber, Utah, mostly in the 1990s. Norm Kohler was the middle school social studies teacher behind the project, and after his passing in 2019 and some collaboration with his estate and the Wasatch Historical Society, I now have the tapes in my office. Over the past year, a CS PhD student named <a href="https://www.alexlyman.org">Alex Lyman</a> has been working on transcribing the tapes using an AI model called <a href="https://github.com/nyrahealth/CrisperWhisper">CrisperWhisper</a> which keeps everything like filled pauses. We’ve found it does a remarkably good job on this audio. Alex is working on a paper that explains the nitty-gritty of that process in more depth, but if you’re interested in doing something similar, let me know. I then processed the 1200 or so files with MFA and new-fave, and I now have a huge spreadsheet of formant measurements to work with.</p>
<p>For this paper, I focused on the <sc>cord-card</sc> merger. While prepping for this, I went into <a href="../../blog/north-force-cloth-start">way too much of a deep dive</a> into <sc>force</sc>, <sc>north</sc>, and <sc>start</sc>. To analyze variation here, I found how what proportion of <sc>north</sc> words are phonetically closer to <sc>start</sc>. Here are two visuals of that, one showing someone with a lower proportion of lowered words and another showing a higher amount.</p>
<div class="quarto-layout-panel" data-layout-ncol="2">

<div class="quarto-layout-cell" style="flex-basis: 50.0%;justify-content: center;">

<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/nwav53/north_as_start_demo1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The gist is that there’s tons of variation, both within and across speakers.</p>
<p>As for results, at the word-level, I found that some words tended to be more <sc>force</sc>-like and others were regularly more <sc>start</sc>-like. This plot shows the most common <sc>north</sc> words and what proportion of people typically had them closer to <sc>start</sc> than <sc>force</sc>.</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/nwav53/north_as_start_by_word.png" class="img-fluid"> They span much of the full range of the <em>x</em>-axis, and are relavely evenly spread out. However, the fact that there is a wide spread means that some words are more often higher and some words are more often lower. This regularity across speakers makes me think it’s a merger by transfer, though I’m still far from making an ultimate conclusion about that.</p>
<p>I found that previous /w/, as in <em>war</em> or <em>warm</em> tended to have higher vowels, as opposed to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1215/00031283-2008-002">Bowie (2008)</a><sup>1</sup>, who found more lowering in that environment. This plot shows the result of a linear regression showing that. Values on the right correspond to being more <sc>force</sc>-like.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Bowie, David. 2008. Acoustic characteristics of Utah’s CARD-CORD merger. American Speech 83(1). 35–61.</p></div></div><p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/nwav53/prev_seg_mdl_coefs.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>For variation across speakers, I didn’t find any effect for gender and, surprisingly, no effect for age. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1215/00031283-78-1-31">Bowie (2003)</a><sup>2</sup> finds increased amounts of <sc>cord-card</sc> merger from the 1860s to the 1890s. My dataset, which is comprised mainly of people born 1910–1935, showed no change in time. Earlier work (Cook 1969<sup>3</sup>, Helquist 1970<sup>4</sup>) suggests decrease during that time. So, again, not sure what makes my results a little different.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Bowie, David. 2003. Early development of the card-cord merger in Utah.

Salt Lake City: University of Utah Unpublished Master’s Thesis.</p></div></div><p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/nwav53/birth_year2.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>One cool thing I found was a marked decrease in the amount of merger among people born in Salt Lake City compared to other people.</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/nwav53/birth_place.png" class="img-fluid"> It’s too early for me to say much about this, but it does suggest that Salt Lake led the shift away from the merger and lends support to the idea that the merger is associated with rural places.</p>

  <title>FORCE, NORTH, CLOTH, and START</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>
  <link>https://joeystanley.com/blog/north-force-cloth-start/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I am doing some research on the <em>cord-card</em> merger in Utah, which means I need to do analyze lexical sets Wells calls <sc>force</sc>, <sc>north</sc>, <sc>cloth</sc>, and <sc>start</sc>. Like <a href="../../blog/mary-merry-marry">other</a> <a href="../../blog/my-cot-caught-distribution">lexical sets</a> I’ve written about, in the absence of comprehensive list of lexemes belonging to these sets, I have to cobble together what I can from various sources and create the list myself. In this post, I’m primarily basing it off what Wells (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/languages-linguistics/phonetics-and-phonology/accents-english-volume-1?format=PB&amp;isbn=9780521297196">1982</a>) says in his definitions of the lexical sets.</p>
<section id="force" class="level2" data-number="1">
<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="force"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> <sc>force</sc></h2>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The <sc>force</sc> set is defined as words that are /ɔː/ in British English but /oɹ/ in American English. Not all /ɔː/ words in British English are <sc>force</sc>. Some may be <sc>thought</sc>, <sc>north</sc>, and maybe <sc>cure</sc> and <sc>cloth</sc>. Since I’m not focused on British English here, I won’t bother with those details.</p>
<p><strong>Historical Roots</strong>: Most <sc>force</sc> words derive from Middle English /ɔː/ before /ɹ/, which is the same source as <sc>goat</sc>. I take this to also mean that Americans “think” of <sc>force</sc> words as having the same vowel as <sc>goat</sc>, and I think that would show up if they had to do a phonological categorization task. However, some <sc>force</sc> words some derive from Middle English /oː/ or /uː/, although I’m not sure which ones those are or how to tell.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution</strong>: Words that are spelled with <em>-ore</em>, <em>-oar</em>, <em>-oor</em>, and <em>-our</em> are <sc>force</sc> unless we know they’re <sc>cure</sc>. Only <em>-or</em> is ambiguous with <sc>north</sc>. <sc>force</sc> may be word-final (<em>store</em>, <em>boar</em>, <em>door</em>, <em>four</em>), before consonants (<em>fort</em>, <em>sword</em>, <em>torn</em>, <em>portrait</em>, <em>hoarse</em>, <em>court</em>), or before vowels (<em>choral</em>, <em>story</em>, <em>historian</em>, <em>Victorian</em>, <em>uproarious</em>).</p>

<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="north"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> <sc>north</sc></h2>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The <sc>north</sc> set is defined as words that are /ɔː/ in British English but /ɔɹ/ in American English varieties that don’t merge <sc>force</sc> and <sc>north</sc>. If the following sound is a vowel (as in <em>horrible</em>, <em>orange</em>), it belongs to <sc>cloth</sc>.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution</strong>: Most <sc>north</sc> words are spelled with <em>or</em> and are preconsonantal (<em>fork</em>, <em>cord</em>, <em>storm</em>, <em>mortal</em>, <em>orbit</em>, <em>corner</em>). Some are spelled with <em>a</em> but it appears to me that all of them are preceded by /w/ (<em>quart</em>, <em>swarm</em>, <em>ward</em>, <em>warm</em>, <em>wart</em>). <sc>North</sc> is very rare word-finally, and a potentially exhaustive list is <em>or</em>, <em>for</em>, <em>nor</em>, <em>Thor</em>, and <em>war</em>. There are also very few in open syllables, but they are all spelled with <em>au</em> and are <em>aura</em>, <em>aural</em>, <em>Laura</em>, and <em>Taurus</em>. See below on other words with <em>au</em>.</p>

<h2 data-number="3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cloth"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> <sc>cloth</sc></h2>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The <sc>cloth</sc> set is defined as words that are merged with <sc>lot</sc> in British English but with <sc>thought</sc> in American English. Non-prerhotic <sc>cloth</sc> typically has a following voiceless fricative, like in <em>coffee</em>, <em>soft</em>, <em>moss</em>, or <em>often</em>, which is the result of a seventeenth-century lengthening rule. These words are almost always spelled with <em>o</em>, but may have an <em>ou</em> (like <em>trough</em> and <em>cough</em>) or <em>au</em> in proper nouns like <em>Austria</em> and <em>Austin</em>. <sc>Cloth</sc> may also appear before velar nasals like <em>long</em> and <em>song.</em> Notably, Wells does not list any pre-/ŋ/ words with <sc>lot</sc> or <sc>thought</sc>, so it seems like any low vowel followed by a velar nasal belongs to <sc>cloth</sc>. Pre-/ɡ/ words are not listed in a lexical set; they are discussed in Volume 3 §6.1.3 (which I don’t have).</p>
<p>Relevant to this study, <sc>cloth</sc> also occurs before intervocalic /ɹ/. These include words like <em>horrible</em>, <em>Florida</em>, and <em>orange</em> which may be variably lowered in some varieties of American English, cheifly in the Northeast, even if those varieties don’t otherwise have variation in <sc>north</sc>. This small list of prerhotic <sc>cloth</sc> is this set of words that are listed in the Wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_vowel_changes_before_historic_/r/#Merger_of_/%C9%92r/_and_/%C9%94r/_before_vowels">English-language vowel changes before historic /ɹ/</a> as being lowered in “Traditional American” which, in a footnote, is defined as NYC area, Philadelphia are, older Southern, older Northeastern elite, and maybe older people in Eastern New England or coastal southern regions.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution</strong>: Most of the time, <sc>cloth</sc> is spelled with <em>o</em>, but sometimes it is with <em>a</em> like in <em>warrant</em>, <em>quarrel</em> or <em>warrior</em>. Presumably the preceding <em>w</em> is relevant since all the examples spelled with a have it. In a few cases (for reasons also unclear to me), it can also be with <em>au</em> like in <em>Laurence</em> and <em>laurel.</em> While Canadians typically pronounce these pre-rhotic <sc>cloth</sc> words with [ɔɹ], it is normal for Americans to lower words like <em>sorry</em> and <em>tomorrow</em>, even if they don’t otherwise have variation in <sc>cloth</sc>.</p>

<p>The <sc>start</sc> lexical set is defined as words that are /ɑː/ in British English but /ɑɹ/ in American English. Not all British /ɑː/ are <sc>start</sc>; some are <sc>bath</sc> and <sc>palm</sc>, but I won’t dive into those here. Wells says that in American English <sc>start</sc> patterns with <sc>lot</sc> phonetically, but in my variety of English, I certainly feel like it patterns more with <sc>thought</sc>.<sup>1</sup></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I will also add that, unlike the others here, my variety of English has a fair amount of <a href="../../blog/ar-raising/">allophony in <sc>start</sc></a>. Read more about that <a href="../../pages/idiolect/#aɹ-raising">here</a>.</p></div></div><p><strong>Historical Roots</strong>: <sc>Start</sc> derives from Middle English /aɹ/, which was affected by a pre-rhotic lengthening rule. Note that this vowel is the same source as <sc>lot</sc>.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution</strong>: It is usually spelled with <em>-ar</em> but <em>-ear</em> and a few others are possible. It can be found word-finally (<em>star</em>, <em>bar</em>), before consonants (<em>sharp</em>, <em>arch</em>, <em>card</em>, <em>farm</em>, <em>party</em>, <em>heart</em>, <em>hearth</em>, <em>sergeant</em>, <em>aardvark</em>). It is rare in open syllables and all the example listed by Wells are borrowings (<em>safari</em>, <em>aria</em>, <em>tiara</em>).</p>

<h2 data-number="5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="guidelines"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Guidelines</h2>
<p>With that said, here are some guidelines I’ve come up with, based on my reading of Wells.</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is spelled with an <em>a</em> and has a preceding /w/, it has to be either <sc>north</sc> or <sc>cloth</sc>. From there, it’s a matter of whether it’s in an open syllable or not (with open-syllables being <sc>cloth</sc>).</li>
<li>If it’s spelled with <em>ar</em> and is not preceded by /l/ or /w/, it’s <sc>start</sc></li>
<li>If it’s spelled with <em>oo</em> or <em>ou</em>, check if it’s <sc>cure</sc>. If Wells doesn’t list it or you can’t otherwise find evidence that it’s <sc>cure</sc>, code it it as <sc>force</sc>.</li>
<li>Other words spelled with <em>ou</em>, <em>ou</em>, <em>oa</em> are <sc>force</sc>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Words spelled with <em>au</em> could be <sc>force</sc> (<em>aura</em>, <em>Laura</em>), <sc>north</sc> (<em>Austria</em>, <em>Austin</em>), or <sc>cloth</sc> (<em>Laurence</em>, <em>laurel</em>). As far as I can tell, there is no pattern.</p>
<p>For words spelled with <em>or</em>, here is what I see:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it’s word-final, it’s <sc>force</sc> unless it’s one of the rare <sc>north</sc> words that Wells lists.</li>
<li>If it’s in an open syllable, it’s also <sc>force</sc> unless it has already been tagged as one of the known <sc>cloth</sc> words.</li>
<li>Any remaining words (preconsonantal environment and spelled with <em>or</em>) are unpredictably <sc>force</sc> or <sc>north</sc> and you’ll have to check with a native speaker or consult a pronunciation dictionary that maintains the distinction.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a native speaker of a variety that maintains a distinction between <sc>north</sc> or <sc>cloth</sc>, I’d love for you to reach out so I can double check my guidelines and classifications.</p>

  <title>MSU Linguistics Colloquium Series</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>
  <link>https://joeystanley.com/blog/msu/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This week, I had the distinct honor of giving an invited talk at Michigan State University as part of their Linguistics Colloquium Series. I always thought that invited talks like this, where the department actually flies you out, where mostly for people that seemed more influential and noteworthy than me. I never thought I’d have a chance to do something like this. It was a very flattering, ego-boosting, morale-lifting visit.</p>
<p>It was a busy and exciting day for me, full of reconnecting with colleagues and meeting new, bright students. But the main event was my talk and you can download a copy of the slides <a href="../../downloads/251017-MSU.pdf">here</a>. It is based on the introduction to the <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/pads/issue/109/1">edited volume</a> that me, Peggy Renwick, and Monica Nesbitt did that talks about the Boomer–Gen X transition and its effect on regional varieties of American English.</p>
<p>I didn’t get a good picture at all during the day, but I did wander around at night and took some awkward selfies.</p>

  <title>Getting Started with Zotero</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>
  <link>https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This page serves as a guide for how to get started with Zotero. It is meant to accompany my lecture on this topic in my Linguistics Tools and Research Methods courses, so it will be focused on what I think my linguistics students will need or want to see the most.</p>
<section id="getting-started" class="level2 page-columns page-full" data-number="1">
<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="getting-started"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Getting started</h2>
<p>Have you found yourself frustrated at how to keep track of all the academic PDFs on your computer? Have you tried to take notes as you read something, but aren’t sure where to keep those notes and how to link them to the PDF you read? Have you read something but forgot what article it was? Are you frustrated with citation formats and spending time making sure your references section matches your in-text citations? Boy do I have a solution for you!</p>
<p>Zotero is a citation management software. That means it can basically solve all those problems for you. It’s open-source and free to use for most people’s needs.<sup>1</sup> The way that I’ll introduce it in this post, it is a stand-alone piece of software that you’ll need to download to your computer, so you’ll need something heftier than a Chromebook or a tablet to get it to work. You can read more about Zotero and its history on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zotero">Wikipedia</a>. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software">competitors</a> out there, Mendeleyand Endnote are probably the most well-known, but I think Zotero is the best.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;There is a subscription service, but in the decade that I’ve been using it, I’ve never felt like I needed it, nor have I felt that my experience was inferior.</p></div></div><p>To install Zotero, simply go to <a href="https://www.zotero.org">Zotero.org</a> and follow the links to download it to your computer. You can install the Zotero connector and mobile app if you want, but I won’t be covering it in this tutorial. Later on, we’ll talk about the word processor plug-ins, which you can install <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_integration">here</a>. Go ahead and open Zotero to get started. It should look something like when when you open it up (you can ignore the various libraries I have on the side of mine):</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/blank.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>An empty library is not very useful. Let’s start adding material to our library.</p>
</section>
<section id="adding-things" class="level2 page-columns page-full" data-number="2">
<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adding-things"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Adding things</h2>
<section id="with-a-doi-or-isbn" class="level3 page-columns page-full" data-number="2.1">
<h3 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="with-a-doi-or-isbn"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> With a DOI or ISBN</h3>
<p>There are multiple ways you can add things. The best way is to find the DOI of the thing you want to add and use that. A <a href="https://www.doi.org/the-identifier/what-is-a-doi/">DOI</a> is a digital identifier object: it’s a stable link to the location of that thing online. <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/641206">Here’s</a> the webpage for an article I’d like to add to my Zotero library. Most articles nowadays have a DOI somewhere among the citation information. I’ve highlighted it on this page.</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/language_webpage.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I’ll copy that string of characters, 10.1353/lan.2016.0078, and go over to Zotero. There’s a little icon that’s meant to look like a magic wand. If I click on that, and paste in the DOI, and hit enter, Zotero will automatically fetch the information about that article and add it to your library.</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/pasting_doi.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/doi_added.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>You can see that it adds a whole bunch of things automatically<sup>2</sup>. On the right panel, there is lots of important metadata about the article, like the author, journal, and where to find it online. Sometimes Zotero will take a snapshot of the webpage so that you can easily find information if it wasn’t added automatically.<sup>3</sup> Sometimes it’ll even download the PDF for you if it can. If it can’t but you can download it manually, you can just drag the file over the entry (in the center panel of Zotero) and the PDF will be added to the entry.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;This, of course, only works if you have an internet connection.</p></div><div id="fn3"><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;I personally never use that, so I’ve changed the setting so that Zotero doesn’t do that.</p></div></div><p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/doi_with_pdf.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The great thing about adding via DOIs is that those links are now included in many reference sections. So if you’re reading an article and you come across a citation that looks interesting, you can just copy the DOI directly from the reference and add it to Zotero without even needing to open a web browser!</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/dois_in_references.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>You can add books by their ISBN if they don’t also have a DOI.<sup>4</sup> <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Principles+of+Linguistic+Change%2C+Volume+1%3A+Internal+Factors-p-9780631179146">Here</a>’s a book I’d like to add.</p>

<p>Just like I did before, I’ll copy it and add it to Zotero by clicking on the magic wand. Now I have two entries in my Zotero library.</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/isbn_in_zotero.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>There are other kinds of unique identifiers that you can add in this way (see more <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/adding_items_to_zotero#add_item_by_identifier">here</a>), but those are the main two that linguistics students will need to know about.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="with-a-pdf"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> With a PDF</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you already have the PDF that you’ve downloaded from the publisher’s website and you just want to add it to your library. Fortunately, you don’t need to go to the publisher’s website again because you can just drag and drop a PDF directly into your Zotero library. If the PDF contains all the right metadata—and they usually will contain at least some—Zotero will pull that metadata out and create an entry with it. You can even drag and drop multiple PDFs all at once, so if you need to transfer an entire folder to Zotero, you can easily do so.</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/copy_pdfs.gif" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Please note that this works best for newer PDFs and ones that come directly from a publisher’s website. If you have a scan, a PDF of an older document, something that has been modified in some way, a PDF from a site that doens’t have a lot of metadata (like a working papers), or an unofficial PDF, this method might not work and it’ll just simply add the PDF as its own entry without any metadata. You can see that this is what happened to the Di Paolo (1992) paper here. In such cases, you’ll need to add the entry manually.</p>

<section id="manually" class="level3 page-columns page-full" data-number="2.3">
<h3 data-number="2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="manually"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Manually</h3>
<p>Adding entries manually is not hard, but you do need to know what kind of information you need to have and what you can leave out. Of course, you can add tons of metadata for every item, but it takes time to fetch and type that information, so it’s good to know what you can leave out. For now, I’ll focus on articles and books, but when we get to the items types below, we’ll go into more depth into the other kinds a student may need to know about.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the case that we have here, where we dragged a PDF over, but there wasn’t any metadata with it. In this case, it’ll be a journal article—I can tell based on the metadata at the top of the PDF. So, I’ll right click on the PDF in Zotero and click on “Create Parent Item…”. It’ll ask for a DOI or to do it manually, so I’ll do it manually.<sup>5</sup> When you first create item, it won’t assume anything about what kind of item it is, so it’ll format it as a generic “Document.” You’ll need to go and change the “Item Type” at the top of the metadata panel on the right to “Journal Article.”</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn5"><p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;In this case, there actually is a DOI if I go back to the publisher’s website. But I’ll pretend there isn’t one so I can practice adding it here.</p></div></div><p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/create_parent.gif" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The most important pieces of information you’ll need for a journal article are the title, the author(s), publication (meaning the name of the journal), volume, issue, pages, date, and (if available) DOI. Usually you can get most of that information on the front page of the paper itself, so I’ll double click on the PDF to open it so I can see it and the metadata at the same time. In this case, pretty much all the information I need is at the very top, so I’ll go ahead and add that in. Again, you could go and fetch other information if you really wanted to, but those are the most important. Here’s what that looks like now that I’m done:</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/manual.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>If you’re creating an entry from scratch, meaning you don’t have a PDF at all but want to add the citation to your Zotero library anyway, the way to do that is to click on the New Item icon to the left of the magic wand. From there, you’re presented with a large list of item types. The most common ones are at the top. Click on “Journal Article” and a new blank entry appears in your Zotero library. You would then add the metadata manually the same as before.</p>
</section>
<section id="check-metadata" class="level3" data-number="2.4">
<h3 data-number="2.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="check-metadata"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Check metadata</h3>
<p>One important thing to keep in mind when adding things automatically is that the metadata may not be correct. It is always a good idea to double-check the metadata to make sure it is accurate. DOIs usually give the most accurate metadata in my experience, with dragging-and-dropping PDFs a little less reliable. Things to watch out for are the Item Type (i.e.&nbsp;if the article comes from a journal, make sure Zotero knows it’s a journal article). Make sure names are spelled correctly and are in the right order. Titles are commonly imported into Zotero in all caps, so you’ll need to manually change those back to lowercase.</p>
<p>It is worth the time to check if things get imported properly. It’ll always be correct from then on out and you won’t have to think about it again. You can read more about editing items <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/adding_items_to_zotero#editing_items">here</a>.</p>

</section>
<section id="item-types" class="level2" data-number="3">
<h2 data-number="3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="item-types"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Item types</h2>
<p>Let’s pause a moment and consider the different item types now. As you saw in the dropdown list, there are lots of kinds of items that Zotero can handle. Each one has its own important kind of metadata. For example, if you’ve got a book, you need to note the publisher. If you’ve got a journal article, you need to note the volume and issue. So, as you add content to your library, you should make sure that each entry is the right Item Type. I’ll focus on three main ones in this section: articles, books, and book chapters.</p>
<section id="articles" class="level3" data-number="3.1">
<h3 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="articles"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Articles</h3>
<p>We’ve already talked about articles already. But since they’ll likely be the most common Item Type in your library, it’s worth repeating what the most important information is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: Make sure it’s not in all caps. If there are special characters, makes sure those are typed correctly. If there are italics or other <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/rich_text_bibliography">rich text</a> in the title, you can add that formatting with html codes, `<i>like this</i>.</li>
<li><strong>Author(s)</strong>: Make sure you have the last name first. If there is more than one, a little plus icon appears after you type the first one and you can add additional authors. Make they’re in the order that they appear in the publication.</li>
<li><strong>Publication</strong> (meaning the name of the journal)</li>
<li><strong>Volume</strong>: Typically a journal has one volume per year. It’s usually an integer, like “12”.</li>
<li><strong>Issue</strong>: The number of times the journal publishes articles per year. Usually it’s a number but sometimes it’s a season, like “Fall 2024”.</li>
<li><strong>Pages</strong>: The pages of that issue that the article appears in. This is getting to be antiquated as things move to digital, but even some online-only journals have page numbers still.</li>
<li><strong>Date</strong>: The year of publication. You can be more specific and put a month and day if you want, and it won’t hurt anything as long as you have a year.</li>
<li><strong>DOI</strong>: It may not be available for everything, but most newer things will have this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensuring that you have all this metadata correct is good for lots of reasons, but it’ll be most apparent when it comes time to export citations and bibliographic entries later on.</p>
</section>
<section id="books" class="level3" data-number="3.2">
<h3 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="books"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Books</h3>
<p>There are five pieces of information you’ll need to properly cite a book. By “book”, I mean a “monograph”, which is a fancy term for a book written by a single author (or set of authors). This is in contrast to an edited volume, which is where each chapter is written by a different author. We’ll get to those in the next section.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: The title of the book. Again, make sure it’s properly formatted.</li>
<li><strong>Author(s)</strong>: The author of the book. Usually for a monograph, there’s just one.</li>
<li><strong>Date</strong>: The year the book was published.</li>
<li><strong>Publisher</strong>: The company that publishes the book.</li>
<li><strong>Place</strong>: The location of the publishing company. This is not required in some citation styles anymore. If there is more than one (like “New York / London”), I just put the first.</li>
</ul>
<p>Books have additional metadata information that is good to add if it’s relevant.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Volume</strong> and <strong>Volume Number</strong>: For a multi-volume work, this is where you’d put that. An example of a multi-volume work would be this <a href="https://www.degruyterbrill.com/serial/vare-b/html">Varieties of English</a> four-volume series, which has volumes on the British Isles, The Americas and the Caribbean, the Pacific Islands and Australisia, and Africa, South, &amp; Southeast Asia.</li>
<li><strong>Series</strong> and <strong>Series Number</strong>: If a book is part of a larger series, you should put the name and number of that series. An example would be the <a href="https://www.degruyterbrill.com/serial/doe-b/html">Dialects of English</a> series or the <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/pads">Publications of the American Dialect Society</a>, each of which have many books that are authored by different people but that form a cohesive series about some topic. There may be series editors. You can add the series editor by initially adding them as an author, but then clicking on “Author” and changing their role to “Series Editor.”</li>
<li><strong>Edition</strong>: If you’re working with a later edition of a book (i.e.&nbsp;2nd edition, 3rd edition, etc), you should put that here. These editions are usually printed on the cover of the book. This is good information to have because page numbers of specific passages change from one edition to the next, as well as some content, so it’s important to make sure you’re citing from the correct edition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other information that you can add if you want would be the <strong># of Pages</strong>, <strong>ISBN</strong>, <strong>URL</strong> (if it’s different from the DOI), and <strong>Call Number</strong>, but that’s not necessary.</p>
</section>
<section id="book-chapters" class="level3" data-number="3.3">
<h3 data-number="3.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="book-chapters"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Book Chapters</h3>
<p>If you are citing one chapter from a monograph, then you cite the entire book using the method in the previous section. However, some books are called “edited volumes.” One or more editors solicit contributions from people and compile those into chapters of a book. The chapters usually go together in some way, hence the theme of the book, and the editors write the introduction and may contribute (to) one or more chapters. The chapters are all independently written by different authors though and serve as stand-alone contributions to the overall theme. You know you’re working with an edited volume when the cover makes it clear that the editor(s) is an editor, usually with “edited by” before or “ed.” after their name. The chapters also list individual authors too rather than the editor’s name or no name at all. If you’re citing a chapter from one of these books, you’ll need to make sure it’s called a “Book Section” in Zotero. Here’s the key information you need.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: This refers to the title of the <em>chapter</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Book Title</strong>: This refers to the title of the <em>book</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Author</strong>: The author of the <em>chapter</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Editor</strong>: The editor of the book. I wish this were clearer in Zotero, but there isn’t a dedicated spot for this information by default. You’ll have to add the chapter author first, and then press the little plus sign, add the editor, and then change their role to editor. In some cases the chapter author may be the editor, in which case you have their name twice.</li>
<li><strong>Pages</strong>: The page range that the chapter occupies in the book.</li>
<li>Plus all the other information for a book, like the date, publisher, place, volume, series, and edition, if relevant.</li>
</ul>

<h3 data-number="3.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="other-item-types"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Other item types</h3>
<p>Of course there are tons of other kinds of items in Zotero. The ones you might encounter are conference paper, theses, and software. I encourage you to look through those item types and see what kind of information you’d need.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="organization" class="level2 page-columns page-full" data-number="4">
<h2 data-number="4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="organization"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Organization</h2>
<p>When you only have a few items in your Zotero library, you don’t have to worry much about organization. But once the number of items exceeds your screensize, organization becomes a much bigger issue. I’ve been using Zotero for 11 years and I have something like 10,000 items in it. So, being able to keep track of and find what you have is something you should learn to do. Fortunately, Zotero has a variety of ways to do this.</p>
<section id="column-headers-and-sorting" class="level3" data-number="4.1">
<h3 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="column-headers-and-sorting"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Column headers and sorting</h3>
<p>First, your library is organized into a spreadsheet-like format. There is one row for each item and one column for each piece of metadata. Like other spreadsheet interfaces, you can click on the columns and it’ll sort your library by that column.</p>
<p>You can also specify which columns you’d like to show. If you right-click on a column name, you’ll see a dropdown list of columns you could include. Ones that are currently shown have a checkmark next to them. You can click and drag columns around to suit your preferences. You can click and drag the edges to change their width. My preference is to have the title, creator, year, publication, item type, date added, and attachments.</p>

<section id="tags" class="level3" data-number="4.2">
<h3 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tags"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Tags</h3>
<p>Once you start to collect many items into your library, it is useful to subset them when searching for something specific or when doing a literature review about a topic. One way that Zotero lets you do this is through tags. You can assign any item a tag by scrolling down on the panel on the right past the metadata until you get to the tags header (you can also just click on the orange tags icon on the right edge of Zotero), clicking the plus sign, and start typing.</p>
<p>Feel free to assign whatever tags you want. You might assign tags based on the broad subfield of linguistics it’s in (“phonetics”, “discourse analysis”), a subset or specific theory (“distributed morphology”, “3rd wave sociolinguistics”). Maybe you want to tag it based on the language or variety that is analyzed (“Tamil”, “Scottish English”) or the method used (“matched guise text”, “content analysis”). I find it useful to assign tags based on more meta topics like if I own the book, what class I used it for, if I’ve checked it out from the library, or of it’s something I’d like to read. I also like to keep track of things I’ve read by year, so I have a tags like “read in 2025” or “read in 2024”. The great thing about tags is you can assign as many as you want to a single item.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you download an article from a publisher’s website, it’ll automatically add tags to it.</p>
<p>Once you have some items with tags, those tags will show up in the Tag Selector window in the bottom left of Zotero. It’ll show all tags in the currently displayed list of items. When you click on a tag, it’ll automatically filter your library to only show items with that tag. The list of tags will also update to only show tags in the remaining items. Tags are a great way to quickly get at a specific subset of your library.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t use tags all that much anymore because it got too hard to maintain. Let’s say I’ve got 100 items in my library and I decide I want to add a new tag to my collection. Well now in order for that tag to be useful, I need to go back to every item in my collection and decide if it should get that tag. With only 100 items, it’s not a huge task to do that, but when you have hundreds or thousands of items, it gets to be a pretty tedious task. I still have some tags for the meta categories like when I read it, but I don’t really use the topical or content-related tags anymore.</p>
<p>See more about tags <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/collections_and_tags">here</a>, including how to edit them and assign colors to them.</p>
</section>
<section id="folders-collections" class="level3 page-columns page-full" data-number="4.3">
<h3 data-number="4.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="folders-collections"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Folders (“Collections”)</h3>
<p>Rather than tags, I like to organize my library into folders (or, as Zotero calls them, “Collections”). This resembles a typical files structure where you have folders and subfolders and content within them.</p>
<p>You can create a collection by right clicking on the “My Library” in the left panel and clicking “New Collection…”. You can create a subcollection by doing the same but selecting “New Subcollection…”. You can drag and drop collections however you want.</p>
<p>To add something to the collection, you just drag and drop an item in your main library view onto the folder icon. The way Zotero does things is that it maintains just one copy of the item, regardless of how many collections it appears in. So, if you drag a single item into five different collections, you’ll still have just one version of it. This is useful because PDF highlights, metadata, and notes are always there, regardless of what collection you view the item in.</p>
<p>When you click on a collection that has subcollections, there are two ways of organizing it. For some people, it makes sense to have the parent collection also contain all the items in the daughter collections. For other people, it’s more useful to be able to add items into the parent collection without the daughter collections getting in the way. I forget which is the default, but I’ve got my Zotero set up to do the latter. You can toggle between them by going to “View &gt; Show Items from Subcollections”.</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/show_items.png" class="img-fluid" width="420"></p>
<p>I use collections pretty extensively. I have four main categories of collections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classes: This contains one subcollection for each course I took when I was a student and for each course I teach now as a professor. It’s a mixed bag of readings I could assign out and ones that have been helpful for me when prepping.</li>
<li>Dialectology:<sup>6</sup> Because the bulk of my research is on American dialectology, I have a subcollection for most US states and Canadian provinces, organized roughly by dialect region. So whenever I come across a new paper where the data was targeting a particular place, I throw it in the appropriate folder. I’ve been doing this for years, so now I can quickly click through and find everything that I’ve encountered about Kansas or Idaho or whatever. It’s very handy. ▶︎</li>
<li>Projects: I have a subcollection for each project I’m working on. This is helpful even for potential projects or back-burner ones because, like the dialectology stuff, whenever I encounter something that might be relevant to it, I throw it in the folder and move on. When it comes time to do a lit review, I’ve got a list of materials right there.</li>
<li>Quantitative stuff: I have subcollections for a variety of quantitative things. Like general data science things, papers that introduce software, quantitative linguistics textbooks and tutorials, packages and software, and statistics textbooks.</li>
</ul>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn6"><p><sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Here’s a peek at my dialectology collection. <img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/subcollections.png" class="img-fluid"></p></div></div><p>You can of course organize your libraries however you see fit, but this is what I’ve settled on after years of using Zotero.</p>
<p>A new feature that I just learned about is that you can see what collection an item is in. On the right edge of the screen when you view an item, there’s a “Libraries and Collections” icon. It looks like a building with pillars and a folder. That’ll jump you to a section of the right panel (under the metadata) that shows which libraries and collections that item is in. So if you primarily use the collections as your main organizational tool, this is a nice way to see all the ways you’ve categorized it. I’ve been wanting a feature like this for a while, so I’m thrilled to see it added.</p>
<p>See more about collections <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/collections_and_tags">here</a>. Also, follow that link if you feel compelled to make sure every item is in a collection and not just a stray paper, because Zotero automatically has a folder for you for unfiled items.</p>

<section id="basic-and-advanced-searches" class="level3" data-number="4.4">
<h3 data-number="4.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="basic-and-advanced-searches"><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Basic and advanced searches</h3>
<p>Zotero offers some useful search features. At the top right of the main library window, you can see a search box with a magnifying glass and the words, “Title, Creator, Year”. Type in whatever you want to search here and it’ll search through your Zotero library. I appreciate that if you click on the little downward arrow next to the magnifying glass, there are three levels of searching.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Title, Creator, Year</strong> search searches through the title, creator, year, and publication only. It is helpful if you are looking for a particular study, like “Eckert 2012” anything with “Northern Cities Shift” in the title. From what I’ve seen, students tend to refer to papers by their titles. That is an intuitive thing to do, but, for whatever reason, academics usually don’t refer to papers that way. We usually refer to them to how we’d cite them in a paper, so by author and year. Regardless, this search lets you do both.</li>
<li>The <strong>All Fields &amp; Tags</strong> search is more comprehensive in its metadata. It’ll search through all fields, tags, and notes. I don’t know if I’ve needed to search through other fields, but I guess if you want to find everything from a publisher like “De Gruyter” you could. I’m not sure if searching tags is that helpful because you can filter by tag anyway. But being able to search your notes is very handy. In fact, you could take advantage if this if you want by putting certain character sequences in your notes so that you can find them quickly.</li>
<li>The <strong>Everything</strong> search looks through all metadata but also the entire text of the PDFs! This is a really cool feature. If you find yourself remembering vaguely something that a paper said, but forgot where you read it, you can quickly find it here. (A more general find on Google Scholar, for example, might turn up many false positives.) This is also good for students looking for research ideas, because you can search phrases like “beyond the scope” or “future work” and find all instances of those in the papers you’ve read.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is an advanced search in Zotero. For that, I encourage you to look through the documentation <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/searching">here</a> to learn more about that.</p>
</section>
<section id="merging" class="level3" data-number="4.5">
<h3 data-number="4.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="merging"><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Merging</h3>
<p>The last organization tool I want to mention is merging. Sometimes, you forget something is in your library and you end up adding it multiple times. This not only leads to messiness in your library, like having PDF highlights on one entry but notes in a different entry, but it can cause issues when you go to cite things. For example, if you add Fridland et al (2016) three times, Zotero thinks those are three entries. If you happened to cite each one, you’d end up with Fridland et al (2016a, 2016b, 2016c), which is not what you want. Fortunately, Zotero makes it easy to fix this.</p>
<p>Zotero actually automatically and constantly checks for duplicate entries. In your library, there is a top-level folder that’s automatically created called “Duplicate items”. If you click on that, you’ll be presented with potential items. Sometimes it gets things wrong though. I have a three-volume set, where each volume is in my library as its own entry, and Zotero thinks they’re duplicates because they have the same title. I’ve noticed though that items have to be the same type, so some duplicates might not be spotted. So, if I save something as a conference proceedings one time and a journal article another time, Zotero won’t catch it.</p>
<p>If you find a duplicate, you can click on one and it’ll highlight the other. You’ll then see a window on the right that has the metadata of them both. You can toggle between them and choose one to be the main one that the other one merges into. You can mix and match metadata if you’d like using that window too. But when you click on “Merge 2 items” they’ll merge into one, and any associated files (PDFs, notes, web snapshots) will be combined.</p>

<h2 data-number="5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="taking-notes"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Taking notes</h2>
<p>It’s probably implied already, but it’s good to say explicitly that in addition to keeping track of all your PDFs, you can also read them directly in Zotero without leaving the app. This is how I read academic content. Like many other PDF readers, Zotero gives you options for highlighting things, which will come in handy in just a second. See <a href="https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-6/">here</a> for information about the PDF Reader.</p>
<p>But, while you’re reading, you should also take advantage of Zotero’s incorporated note-taking feature. This is extremely handy for me. I often take careful notes while reading articles and it’s nice to have them saved together with the PDF itself and the item’s metadata.</p>
<p>There are two ways of adding a note to a Zotero entry. One is to click on the entry in your library and on the top panel, click on the note icon and click “New Item Note”. <sup>7</sup> The other way of adding a note is to open a PDF directly, and on the far right of the screen, click on the notes icon, and then the plus sign next to “Item Notes” and click on “Item Item Note”.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn7"><p><sup>7</sup>&nbsp;The only times I use the “New Standalone Note” is if I need to make a comment about a (sub)collection. I’ve done this when explaining what the subcollection is for (sort of a readme file) or if I need to summarize the contents really quickly. The note is associated with that collection so whenever I jump to that folder, it’s there.</p></div></div><p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/add_item_note.png" class="img-fluid" width="420"> <img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/add_item_note2.png" class="img-fluid" width="420"></p>
<p>Either way, once you do that A new note item appears under that entry, and a note-taking view appears in the right panel. From here, you can treat it like any other basic word processor. You can add headers, change fonts, and other rich text things (like italics, hyperlinks, images<sup>8</sup>).</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn8"><p><sup>8</sup>&nbsp;One time I got an old Master’s Thesis on Inter Library Loan. They wouldn’t let me take it out of the Special Collections room. So I ended up taking a lot of photos of the most important pages. I was able to incorporate those into a note.</p></div></div><p>There are several reasons why I add notes to my Zotero entries.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every time I add something to my library, I try to add a <strong>why did I add this</strong> note. It’s easy to add a lot of things to your library, especially with the online plug-ins. It can quickly get overwhelming when you have many entries that you don’t remember adding. So, after checking the metadata, I add a quick note saying something like, “I saw this cited in Holliday (2024) about intonation and it looked interesting” or “This popped up on my list of recommended books on Amazon” or “we read this in my semantics class”. That’s it. Just a reminder to your future self.
<ul>
<li>I also add these notes when I add things to certain subcollections. So, if I’m reading a paper and they use a particular method I’m interested in, I’ll add that to the collection on that method and say, “On page 62 they mention Pillai scores” or whatever.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Relatedly, I sometimes add notes to things as reminder of <strong>who cites this and why</strong>. This is helpful for when you’re doing a deep dive into a topic and you notice the same citation over and over but you haven’t read it yet. Or, sometimes I’ll add something to your library that I don’t have access to (a book from the 1980s or something) but I want to keep track of what people have said about it. After seeing a few citations, I can get a feel for what people know about it.</li>
<li>The most detailed notes are ones where I take notes during or after reading it. I start mine with information about when and where I read it (“Read August 25–26 while on the bus”). If it’s an important paper for me, I’ll leave extensive notes about what I want to remember. The goal for these notes is to be detailed enough so that in a few years if I need to come back to this paper, I can get the gist from just my summary. In other cases, I’ll leave a few paragraphs of comments after I’ve finished it so I can remember the most important things about the paper.
<ul>
<li>It’s also useful to leave subjective commentary about the piece. If I intersperse my comments within the larger summary note, I make it clear with formatting so that Future Me doesn’t think that those ideas were from the author. But usually I leave a paragraph at the top or bottom of my notes with thoughts about how great it was, how much didn’t like the methods, or other subjective evaluations.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes I’ll have multiple notes associted with a single entry, like if I need to hit more than one of these categories. You use whatever method you like with your Zotero library. In my opinion, it never hurts to take notes. But you do what works best for you.</p>
<p>The last way you can kinda keep notes is to generate a note from highlights in the PDF. If you use Zotero’s PDF reader and highlight text directly in Zotero itself, you can export those highlighted sentences into a single note. This is a handy way to summarize a paper for Future You to read without having to type everything out. It is also nice because it makes those highlights searchable using the “All Notes and Tags” search mentioned above.</p>
<p>If you want to go the extra mile in categorizing things, you can add tags to individual notes and you can add comments to individual highlights. I don’t need that kind of detail most of the time, but it’s there in case you need it.</p>

<h2 data-number="6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="integration-with-word-and-googledocs"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Integration with Word and GoogleDocs</h2>
<p>Zotero as a standalone piece of software does so much already. But the cherry on top is its integration with Microsoft Word and Google Docs. With these tools you never have to worry about formatting or making sure your references section matches your in-text citations.</p>
<section id="installation" class="level3" data-number="6.1">
<h3 data-number="6.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="installation"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Installation</h3>
<p>I encourage you to go [here] for specific instructions on how to integrate these two for the tool that you plan on writing in. I’ll show screenshots in Word, but they’re basically the same across all platforms.</p>
</section>
<section id="in-text-citations" class="level3" data-number="6.2">
<h3 data-number="6.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="in-text-citations"><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> In-text citations</h3>
<p>There are two main functions when using the integration tools. First are the in-text citations. When you’re typing in your document and you’re ready to cite something, you can click on the Zotero tab and then click on “Add/Edit Citation”. (Note: the Zotero application needs to be open on your computer for this to work.)</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/add_edit_citation.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The first time you do this in a document, you’ll see a window asking about document preferences. Here, you’ll select which bibliographic style you want to use. Read more about these styles, including how to download new ones and switch between them, <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/styles">here</a>. I almost always use the Unified Stylesheet for Linguistics, and if you don’t have that installed already, it is useful to do so.</p>
<p>Once that’s done, and every time you click on “Add/Edit Citation” from here on out in this document, you’ll then see a wide red and white bar that has a searchbox. Here, you can search for the item(s) that you want to cite. By default, Zotero will have right there the documents you have open or what you have highlighted in your library, so if you were just reading something, it’ll be there for you. If you need to cite something else, you can start typing search terms like the author, year, or title, and they’ll show up.</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/add_item.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Click on the document you want to cite and you’ll see it added to the list. If you need to cite multiple documents, just keep on searching and adding. You can add as many as you want.</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/multiple_citations.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>For now, let’s hit enter and see what that does to our document. You can see (below) that it adds them all as in-text citations in the way that in-text citations are formatted. I have my settings in Word such that when the cursor is in them (or any automatically generated text), it’s highlighted in gray. Note that the order of the citations in the document reflects the order in the red bar, so if you want to cite them in a particular order (alphabetical, chronological, etc) then you’ll need to be the one to do that.</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/multiple_citations_in_word.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>There are ways to fine-tune how these get incorporated into the document, but let’s hit references sections before moving on.</p>
</section>
<section id="references-sections" class="level3" data-number="6.3">
<h3 data-number="6.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="references-sections"><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> References sections</h3>
<p>So, let’s say you’ve written your paper and you’re ready to add your references section. As long as you’ve used Zotero to add all your entries, it knows everything that has been cited. With the click of a single button, you can add the entire perfectly formatted references section.</p>
<p>Back to Word, I’ll click on “Add/Edit Bibliography”. In just a couple seconds (maybe longer if you have a lot of citations), the bibliography is there! You never again have to worry about what goes in italics, where commas should be, alphabetizing your list, or making sure the in-text citations match the references section. It’s done!</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/bibliography.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The magical thing about this is that is regularly updates as you type your document. If you go back to the body of your paper and add a citation or remove one, the bibliography updates at the same time!</p>
<p>Now, hopefully you see the importance of making sure the metadata in your Zotero entries is correct. Word is just pulling information straight from Zotero, so if you’ve got wrong, missing, or badly formatted metadata in Zotero, it’ll show up here. In this case, I need to go back and fix the capitalization in that Bowie (2008) paper. This is also the reason why it’s important to make sure you have the right File Type in Zotero, because it’ll cite things incorrectly if it’s not stored in the correct way.</p>
</section>
<section id="customizing-in-text-citations" class="level3 page-columns page-full" data-number="6.4">
<h3 data-number="6.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="customizing-in-text-citations"><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Customizing in-text citations</h3>
<p>Going back to the in-text citations, there are some things you can do to make it work better for you. First, to edit an in-text citation, put your cursor anywhere in that generated text and click “Add/Edit Citation.” You’ll see the red search bar just as you left it. From here you can add more or, by hitting the backspace key, remove citations. Remember that the bibliography will automatically update when you do so.</p>
<p>There are some other features to be aware of. I’ll work from the bottom. First, you can <strong>omit the author</strong>. Zotero will just add the year in parentheses for this one. This is useful if you’re using the Author as a noun phrase in your actual writing. For example, you could say “Propredictate <em>do</em> is found in Utah (Di Paolo 1993)”, in which case you’d use the citation like normal. Or, you could say “Di Paolo (1992) finds propredictate <em>do</em> in Utah.” In this case, you’d type the name of the author and then let Zotero add the year. Another use is if you have multiple citations from the same person in a list, like “(Bowie 2003, 2008, 2012)”. In that case, I’d omit the author on all but the first one. Otherwise it’d say “(Bowie 2003, Bowie 2008, Bowie 2012)”.</p>
<p>The <strong>prefix</strong> and <strong>suffix</strong> options are nice, if you want to add brief additional commentary.<sup>9</sup> So, if you want to say something like “In studies of grammatical variation in Utah (see, e.g., Di Paolo 1992 among others)…”, I would add “see, e.g.,” in the “prefix” slot and “among others” in the “suffix” slot. Note that the prefix and suffix content is always inserted inside the parentheses in your word processor.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn9"><p><sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Read more about these <a href="https://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/bluebook-legal-citation/intro-signals">here</a>.</p></div></div><p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/see.png" class="img-fluid"> <img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/see2.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Finally, you can add page numbers. You should always provide a page number when directly quoting somebody. As a rule of thumb, I also add page numbers whenever I cite a book. You can do that by adding the page in the “Page” part of the entry. Those page numbers get added according to the style that you have set for your document. In the case of the Unified Stylesheet for Linguistics, is a colon, space, and the numbers, separated by an en-dash.</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/page_numbers.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>If you want to cite something that’s not a page, but a figure, a footnote, or some other thing, you can cite that instead of a page<sup>10</sup>. You can of course mix and match these features however you want.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn10"><p><sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Zotero can handle many more things than what I’ve ever seen in linguistics research, but here’s the complete list <img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/list_of_options.png" class="img-fluid"></p></div></div><p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/crossover.png" class="img-fluid"></p>

<h3 data-number="6.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="one-off-citations"><span class="header-section-number">6.5</span> One-off citations</h3>
<p>Finally, it’s worth pointing out that you don’t need to integrate with a word processor to generate bibliographic entries. If you right click an item in your Zotero library and click “Create bibliography from item”, you’ll see a window with some options. You can choose from the citation styles again, whether you want the int-text one or the bibliographic entry (you probably want the latter), and how you want to export it (you probably want to save it to your clipboard).</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/zotero/export_citation.png" class="img-fluid"> From there, you can paste it wherever, like an email or texting with your friends and family ;) The result will look just as it does in a bibliography section of a paper.</p>

<h2 data-number="7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="and-so-much-more"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> And so much more!</h2>
<p>There is so much more to Zotero than what I could cover here. I encourage you to click around and get a feel for the software. You can also explore these topics:</p>

<p>Plus, you can read the <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/">official documentation</a>, <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/third_party_documentation">tutorials and guides written by other people</a>, and numerous <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/screencast_tutorials">video tutorials</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you find Zotero useful for you. Again, I couldn’t function as an academic without it. I was called a “Zotero Evangelist” by a former student, so hopefully this tutorial has convinced you that you should start using it too!</p>

  <title>Testing out the tidynorm package</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>
  <link>https://joeystanley.com/blog/tidynorm/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Josef Fruehwald has recently released the <a href="https://jofrhwld.github.io/tidynorm/">tidynorm</a> R package. It “provide[s] convenient and tidy functions to normalize vowel formant data.” Since I normalize my data a lot and am entrenched in the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org">tidyverse</a>, I thought I’d give it a try, especially since I have also written some functions that normalize vowel data and I wanted to compare them. <strong>After playing around <code>tidynorm</code>, I can confidently say it’s a <em>lot</em> better than what my R packages did.</strong> So, the purpose of this post is to</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Show a little bit of what <code>tidynorm</code> can do.</p></li>
<li><p>Convince you to switch from the normalization functions in my own packages (namely, <code>joeyr</code>) and to <code>tidynorm</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>On this page, I walk through the functions in <code>tidynorm</code> that normalized point-based (i.e.&nbsp;not trajectory) formant data. I’ll follow along <a href="https://jofrhwld.github.io/tidynorm/articles/norm-methods.html">this article</a>. As I go through each one, I’ll show how you can implement each method using my own packages if applicable, and how it’s done in <code>tidynorm</code>. Hopefully by the end, I will have convinced you to start adopting <code>tidynorm</code>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lobanov-normalization">Lobanov normalization</h2>
<p>Though Barreda (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954394521000016">2021</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2025.101409">2025</a>) advises against Lobanov normalization, I’ll start there because it’s probably the most familiar to the most number of people. Lobanov normalization is straightforward and can be easily implemented with the <code>scale</code> function in base R. Here’s a more verbose way of doing things:</p>

<p>So, the output is identical. The benefit of using <code>scale</code> is that you pop the hood a little bit and it’s easier to see what mathematically is happening. The benefit of using <code>norm_lobanov</code> is that it’s easy to see that you’re doing the Lobanov normalization.</p>
<p>One thing that I think is worth mentioning here—and this will be true of all the <code>tidynorm</code> functions I show here—is that there are two changes to the dataframe other than the addition of new normalized vowel formant columns. First, there is a new <code>.id</code> column, which just shows the row numbers. That gets added during the normalization procedure and apparently stays. Also, the order of columns has shifted a little bit. The formant columns are now located before the vowel column.</p>
<p>Also, please note that <code>tidynorm</code> function calls by default return some helpful information that provides some good feedback to make sure you’ve normalized the way you meant to. For me though, those messages were causing some issues in my R console, so throughout this post I’ll use <code>.silent = TRUE</code> anytime I run a <code>tidynorm</code> function. Be sure to look at the output in your own code though, which you can can always do with <code>check_norm</code>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="logmeans-neary-normalization">Logmeans (=Neary) normalization</h2>
<p>My go-to normalization procedure now is the Nearey method, thanks to Barreda’s work. In my <code>joeyr</code> package, I had a function called <code>norm_logmeans</code>, which handled everything as best I could. (Although it was crashing for some users, and I’m not sure why.) It was pretty clunky because it required you to log transform the formant measurements first and I always ended up renaming the columns afterwards anyway. Because it was inhereted code, it also was a departure from <code>tidyverse</code> under the hood, so the result didn’t get returned as a tibble.</p>

<p>As I was playing with this, I realized that my own <code>norm_logmeans</code> function wasn’t necessarily returning the same output. I found out it was for two reasons. First, I have been using <code>log10</code> instead of <code>log</code> as input. I’m now pretty concerned that I might has messed up a lot of people’s analyses, including my own! The other reason was I had to make sure that I was using all the same formants (F1–F3 and not just F1 and F2) when doing the two procedures to get them to match. Fortunately, they do, which means my <code>norm_logmeans</code> function did indeed have the match all incorporated correctly. Still, I’d recommend switching over to <code>tidynorm</code> because it’s a whole lot less clunky than my own version.</p>

<p>But, this too was a bit clunky because rather than passing in all the formant columns at once, it actually required F1, F2, and F3 to be separate arguments. As expected, <code>tidynorm::norm_deltaF</code> handles this in a much more straightforward manner.</p>

<p>One (of several) major benefits to <code>tidynorm</code> is its consistency in syntax. All three of my normalization procedures had different syntax, which reflected wildly different implementations under the hood. It was not good. <code>tidynorm</code>’s functions are all consistent because they actually call a more general <code>norm_generic</code>.</p>

<p>The last one that I’ve written code for that <code>tidynorm</code> handles so much better is the Bark Difference Metric. This was once a part of <code>joeyr</code> but I moved it to <code>barktools</code> instead. Here’s how you’d get the Bark Difference Metric using that package. First, you calculate the barks, and then you manually get the difference metric.</p>

<p>Like what we saw with the Lobanov method above, the benefit of using the more lower-level functions is that you are more closely connected to the math. The downside is that it’s prone to error and it’s not clear from the code what it’s actually doing. The benefit of this <code>norm_barkz</code> function is that it’s all wrapped up into one tidy function and the purpose is clear. In this case the <code>F1_bz</code> and <code>F2_bz</code> columns correspond to the difference metrics. The <code>F3_bz</code> column is not helpful since it’s just <code>Bark(F3) - Bark(F3)</code>, which is zero, so you can drop it.</p>

<p>As you can see here, <code>tidynorm</code> handles various normalization procedures in a simple way with consistent syntax across functions. While some of my functions kinda worked, this works way better.</p>
<p>In fact, as of today, <strong>I have depreciated the three normalizations functions within <code>joeyr</code></strong> (<code>norm_logmeans</code>, <code>norm_anae</code>, and <code>norm_deltaF</code>). The functions still do exist, but they do nothing other than give a message saying that you should switch to <code>tidynorm</code>. This means, if you update to <code>joeyr</code> version 0.10, it’ll introduce breaking changes into your code. If you want to keep using my functions, you can by adding <code>joeyr_</code> as a prefix to the function name (e.g.&nbsp;<code>joeyr_norm_logmeans</code>).</p>
<p>There is more to <code>tidynorm</code> beyond what I’ve shown here, namely that it handles normalizing trajectory data and DCT coefficients, but I’ll have to play around with those later.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’m thrilled to announce my latest journal article, “LTH Affrication: A sociolinguistic indicator in the American West”, co-authored with <a href="https://jessicashepherd.github.io">Jessica Shepherd</a>, has been published in <em>Journal of English Linguistics</em>! Jess was an undergraduate at BYU and was an RA for me when we started this project. She is now a PhD student at Michigan State and <a href="https://mi-diaries.org/2023/08/28/9798/">is working</a> on the <a href="https://mi-diaries.org">MI Diaries project</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t remember when I first noticed the phenomena that we’re calling “LTH Affrication”, but sometime maybe five years ago I started hearing people pronounce words like <em>health</em> and <em>stealth</em> with some sort of pause between the /l/ and /θ/. In the manuscript, we transcribe it as a dental affricate [t̪͡θ]. I don’t think I’ve ever seen this mentioned in linguistics literature at all, so it’s kind of exciting to be the first to describe something!</p>
<p>Here are the examples we showed in Figure 2 of the paper.</p>

<p>At first, I thought it was some sort of [t]-insertion similar to what I occasionally hear in words like <em>false</em> and <em>else</em>. An earlier version of the manuscript called it <em>t</em>-excrescence, that word referring to a specific kind of insertion where consonant is inserted between two other consonants. When a reviewer pushed back on the obscure jargon term, we reconsidered the name. We eventually decided insertion implies a phonological process that we’re not fully committed to, and we instead opted for a more descriptive, phonetic name, <em>affrication</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-study" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-study">The study</h3>
<p>Around the time I was hearing this affrication, I was starting two different data collection projects that involved wordlists. So I threw in a couple LTH words just to see what would happen. The data from one of these projects eventually became the dataset for this study and we got recordings from 265 people, mostly from the region we’re calling the Middle Rockies, which includes Utah, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.</p>
<p>A surprising number of people—about a third—had LTH affrication! We didn’t expect it to be so high, so that was pretty cool for us. However, despite being so variable, none of the demographic variables we collected were significant predictors for whether someone had affrication or not. It seems to occur somewhat randomly across our sample. We take this as evidence that LTH affrication is an <em>indicator</em> in the Labov (1972:178–180) sense, which are linguistic variables that are socially invisible. We’ve scoured the internet for comments on English in the region and we have not found anybody saying anything about words with /lθ/, even though a third of people have it. It’s kinda cool to catch such an under-the-radar linguistic variable.</p>
<p>Focusing then on the 88 people who did have affrication, we looked at the duration of the closures in that affricate. Women, suburban-oriented people, and practicing Latter-day Saints had the longest closure durations. Age was not a significant predictor, but there is weak evidence that Utahns have longer durations too. So, there may be some social meaning involved in those durations (see Hallie Davidson’s <a href="../../downloads/241109-NWAV_ClosureDurations.pdf">work-in-progress</a> on exploring that specifically!), which would be a cool thing to discover.</p>
</section>
<section id="theoretical-implications" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="theoretical-implications">Theoretical implications</h3>
<p>In the paper, we discuss at length the idea of infrequent phonological variables. LTH Affrication certainly qualifies: there are only about four commonly used words with /lθ/: <em>health</em>, <em>wealth</em>, <em>stealth</em>, and <em>filth</em>, plus their derived forms. We estimate that you might hear /lθ/ roughly once every 51 minutes of continuous speech. The only real way to study such infrequent variables is to elicit them directly with wordlists or reading passages. We compare this to /æɡ/- or /ɛɡ/-raising, which people have specifically mentioned not being able to study because of a lack of data. However, we observe that /æɡ/-raising in places like Washington State still have complex indexical fields, similar to more common variables like /æ/-lowering, /t/-release, and ING. If it takes fewer tokens to accrue such complex meanings, listeners apparently store rich sociolinguistic information with every instance of every variable, which is exactly what Exemplar Theory proposes.</p>
<p>We then talk about how LTH Affrication appears to be part of the Latter-day Saint religiolect. This is yet another example of how fortition generally is common among Latter-day Saint Utahns and we speculate as to why fortition would be used as a linguistic device to index one’s Latter-day Saint identity. Part of this is also tied up with the idea of suburban identity because most of the Wasatch Front, where 90% of Utahns live and is where the core Latter-day Saint culture is found, is one long stretch of suburbs. We also point out that former Latter-day Saints pattern more with people of other faiths, which not only strengthens the idea that LTH is associated with Latter-day Saints, but also acknowledges this group as distinct from practicing Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>There are lots of places where insertion or affrication happens in English: <em>empty</em>, <em>glimpse</em>, <em>pumpkin</em>, <em>el</em>[t]<em>se</em>, <em>prin</em>[t]<em>ce</em>, <em>ham</em>[p]<em>ster</em>, <em>warm</em>[p]<em>th</em>, <em>streng</em>[k]<em>th</em>, and <em>ten</em>[t]<em>sion</em>. All of these have sonorants followed by obstruents. Are there communities that have such insertion or affrication in /lf/ (<em>itself</em>, <em>golf</em>, <em>welfare</em>), /lʃ/ (<em>expulsion</em>, <em>convulsion</em>, <em>propulsion</em>), /mf/ (<em>emphasis</em>, <em>comfort</em>, <em>triumph</em>), or /nθ/ (<em>month</em>, <em>tenth</em>, <em>anthem</em>)?</p>
<p>Anyway, it has been a fun paper to work on and I’m thrilled to finally see it in print.</p>

<section id="behind-the-scenes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the scenes</h2>
<p>I like hearing about the behind the scenes of others’ papers, so here’s that background on this one.</p>
<p>On September 8, 2022, Jess stopped by my office out of the blue, started chatting about things, looked through a lot of the data I had just collected a few months prior, and we got interested in LTH because she’s heard it before. I have in my notes that it was such a small topic that I wasn’t planning on doing a full publication on it, but because a student was interested in it, I changed my mind!</p>
<p>Later that month, we met again. Jess had reviewed what others have said about <em>excrescence</em> and we decided that closure duration was the thing we’d focus on. At the time we were considering <em>English Language and Linguistics</em> since we didn’t think we could make enough of a theoretical contribution for it to be in <em>Journal of English Linguistics</em></p>
<p>By the end of Fall 2022, I had finished transcribing all the data and had gotten duration measurements. We had basically found the results that we presented in the paper. The methods and results sections of the paper were written.</p>
<p>In February 2023, I recoded all the data and got new duration measures since I noticed a bit of an error in how I did it before. The general findings were unchanged though. On February 10, 2023 I was in the zone and wrote about 1800 words, mostly in the literature review. By February 27th, we had a full manuscript.</p>
<p>In March 2023, we submitted to <em>Language Variation and Change</em>, but got a very fair desk reject. So we made some changes and on March 15th, submitted it to <em>Journal of English Linguistics</em>. I guess I was feeling good about the theoretical contribution that this makes.</p>
<p>We got our first R&amp;R from them on August 17th, 2023, about five months after submission. However, it was terrible timing for both of us. I had just started parental leave so I wasn’t going to work on it for several months. And Jess had just moved across the country and was about to start her first year of her PhD program, so she wasn’t available to work on it either. We finally revisited the reviews in February 2024 and on March 15th, we resubmitted it to <em>JEngL</em> (exactly one year after our first submission).</p>
<p>We got a conditional accept on April 2, 2025 (12½ months after we submitted). I’m not quite sure why it took <em>JEngL</em> so long. We resubmitted on April 22 and got the official accept on May 2. It was published online today, June 17th.</p>
<p>So from initial idea to publication took about three years.</p>

<p>This is one of the coolest clips I have. Here is a recording and spectrogram of someone saying <em>both</em>. But, not only does she have [l] insertion in the word, saying it as if it were <em>bolth</em>, but she then has LTH-affrication on top of it!</p>

  <title>Kohler Tapes (Update #3)</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I am ecstatic to report that I have now have my Kohler Tapes collection processed! In this post, I’ll give an update on how I was able to process so much data. I’ll also give a really quick demonstration of how to use new-fave and I’ll show some of the very first vowel plots from this dataset, even as I see them!</p>
<section id="background" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I’ve given some explanations of the Kohler Tapes collection <a href="../../blog/kohler-tapes">here</a>, <a href="../../blog/kohler-tapes-update">here</a>, and <a href="../../blog/kohler-tapes-update2">here</a>, so I won’t give a full history of the processing here. But, in January 2018, I met Norm Kohler in Heber, Utah. When he was a middle school teacher there in the 80s and 90s, he asked his students interview their grandparents or some other older person in town as part of a local history unit. He collected 1200 tapes and intended to write a compilation of some of these oral narratives. He unfortunately never did and after his passing, the tapes fell into the custody of the Wasatch Historical Society. They knew I was interested in the tapes, so they got into contact and in 2021, I finally got the tapes.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, I carefully photographed and cataloged the 751 tapes. BYU’s Office of Digital Humanities digitized them, and I learned I had 631 hours of audio from 806 interviewees from 1986 to 2001. Thanks to a John Topham and Susan Redd Butler BYU Faculty Research Award from the <a href="https://reddcenter.byu.edu">Charles Redd Center for Western Studies</a>, I hired an RA to listen to the first few minutes of each tape to write down any demographic information she could gather. She was then able to find over half the people in a genealogy database, which we used to fill out the rest of the metadata. With that, I learned that the birth years were from 1892 to 1953 and most people were from Wasatch County.</p>
<section id="transcription" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transcription">Transcription</h3>
<p>With that metadata filled out, I had to start the arduous task of transcribing all of these tapes. The problem is it was simply too much for me to do. It took me <a href="../../blog/transcribing-a-sociolinguistic-corpus/index.html">172 hours</a> of work to transcribe about 46½ hours of audio for my dissertation. At that rate, it would take me 2,334 hours to do all of these tapes. Even when I was highly motivated during my dissertation transcription, I couldn’t do more than about two hours of work a day without burning out, so if I plan on just two hours a day, it’d end up taking me 1,167 work days, or 233 work weeks, or about 5 years. Two hours a day for five years. No way.</p>
<p>Well, I thought maybe I could hire some students to move things along and divide the labor. I’ve found that student transcribers are typically a bit slower, so based on previous work I supervised, I calculated that it’d take a team of about 14 student workers two years to get it all done. Not to mention the roughly $100,000 I’d need to pay them. I don’t foresee myself securing a grant that big or managing a lab that involved for a while. So intimidated by the amount of audio, the tapes sat untranscribed for a couple years.</p>
<p>Then, about a year ago, a bright new student expressed interest in the project. So applied for an received an Annaley Naegle Redd Assistantship, also awarded by the Redd Center. That paid for that student to begin transcribing a few key tapes. I’ve already <a href="../../blog/kohler-tapes-update2/">mentioned</a> that I was interested in Wallsburg, so we selected a few tapes from there and from Heber to be the first ones to analyze.</p>
<p>Well so then in Fall 2024 I attended a talk by a PhD student in computer science who has a background in linguistics. The talk was basically, “Here’s all the cool stuff that linguists can do with AI.” I’ve already <a href="../../blog/whisper/index.html">tried using Whisper</a> to transcribe some of these tapes with some success. But most of what my RA had been doing for transcription was correcting those AI-generated transcriptions, and most of that time was adding back in the speech errors and filled pauses that Whisper didn’t include. When I spoke to the CS student presenter about this he said, it would certainly be feasible to use AI to transcribe the rest of tapes.</p>
<p>So, over the next several months, the CS student started working on this.<sup>1</sup> At first, we tried fine-tuning Whisper. He said with about 10 hours of manually transcribed audio from a wide variety of tapes, that’d be enough to get Whisper to perform better on this collection, namely the audio quality, the variety of English, and the speech errors. So, my RA transcribed a random 10 minutes from numerous tapes and we used that train Whisper.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I insisted on him teaching me how to do it so I wouldn’t be so reliant on him, but he basically said, “with all due respect, it would take you a long time to learn how to do this, and I can do this while watching Netflix. It would just be easier if I did it.” Fair enough! Hooray for collaborations!</p></div></div><p>In January 2025, we discovered that it wasn’t doing as well as we had hoped. But, the CS student heard about a model called <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16589">CrisperWhisper</a>. It’s a fine-tuned version of Whisper that claims to transcribe every spoken word exactly as is, including fillers, pauses, stutters, and false starts. Perfect! So, the CS student started playing with it and we found that the results were quite good! There is some nuance and complexity that is involved in getting this to work, but I’ll explain more of that another time. The point is, we were now ready to start transcribing all the audio.</p>
<p>Over the next six weeks or so, the CS student used BYU’s supercomputer to transcribe the tapes. It took a while because 1) it is a complex task, 2) this is a lot of audio to work with, and 3) other tasks sometimes took priority so we were often bumped down the processing queue. But he got it done!</p>
<p>The next step for the student was to turn those transcriptions into a format that is suitable for me, namely a Praat TextGrid. What underlies this though was extensive checking to make sure it did a good job. This took most of that semester, partly because this is a back-burner project for this student and I had a busy time teaching so I didn’t have much time to help.</p>
<p>But on May 22, 2025, I finally got my first copy of the TextGrids! There are still some issues to work out, like correcting some things, making sure boundaries don’t overlap, converting numerals to text, and most importantly, speaker diarization. But, I’m super excited to have these transcriptions finally! I can now say there are approximately 4.7 million words of transcribed audio in this collection.</p>

<section id="forced-alignment" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="forced-alignment">Forced Alignment</h3>
<p>While the CS student’s work is mostly done, sociophoneticians know that this is just the beginning of the pipeline of data processing. My next task was to use the Montreal Forced Aligner to take those utterance-level transcriptions and turn them into word- and phoneme-level transcriptions.</p>
<p>My first step was to rethink how I had been running MFA. Normally, I use a custom Praat script to move the files to the MFA folder and clean them up along the way, like removing things that I know will slow MFA down. Once I run MFA, I then have a post-processing script to move them back and to some other cleaning up. This is a one-file-at-a-time kind of task, and while that’s fine for all my projects so far, it was not going to work for this one. I have about 1,184 files (751 tapes, many of which have content on side B). And since I know the transcriptions I have are just a first pass, I’ll need to run these again at some point (perhaps multiple times). This means that I really needed to find a way to run them all at once.</p>
<p>Fortunately, MFA can handle many files at the same time. And all the transcriptions were in one folder already. However, I ran into some trouble and I’m not sure what was wrong. Perhaps it’s just my unfamiliarity with MFA, but I could not get it to run on all the files at once.<sup>2</sup> What I eventually did was move all the files to their respective folders and generate the command line prompt to run each one. I then dumped all of those commands into a shell script and had MFA run all of them in succession. (I wrote an R script to automate this entire process.) I’ll probably do a blog post about it at some point because I think it worked quite well. So, after a few days of working on this, I eventually was able to process all the files with the click of a button. And 36 hours later, the forced alignment was done!</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;One issue was that it considered all the tapes a single speaker, even though the file names were different. I even tried changing the tier names in each file and that didn’t help. for whatever reason, this means that only a few words in each file were transcribed.</p></div></div></section>
<section id="formant-extraction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="formant-extraction">Formant Extraction</h3>
<p>The next step is to extract formants. I wanted to try <a href="https://forced-alignment-and-vowel-extraction.github.io/new-fave/">new-fave</a> because 1) it’s new, 2) it looks fantastic, 3) it’s the only automated way I know of to do all the files. Fortunately, getting that script set up was straightforward. After my success with MFA, I decided to use the same approach and generate a shell script that processes each file one at a time. I couldn’t use FAVE’s built-in function for handling lots of files because the file structure for this project wasn’t conducive to it, and that’s fine. Again, I’ll probably do a tutorial on this soon because it worked really well.</p>
<p>The tricky part was just the size of the collection. I’ve learned that reading and writing too much on an external harddrive can cause problems. These files were in some cloud storage, which worked for a while, but it caused some memory problems partway through because files weren’t downloading. So I moved the entire collection to my computer’s harddrive and continued from there. It was moving slowly, but it was moving.</p>
<p>It took about five days of non-stop processing on my computer, but I’m thrilled to see that as of 2:04pm today, all the files were processed. I am writing this at 2:11pm, so I’m still in the euphoria of having the data finished. So, come with me as I process the files for the first time.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that each filename corresponds to a side of a tape. I am just a little bit too young to really be familiar with cassette tapes, but I guess tapes back then could hold either about 32 or maybe 48 minutes of audio, so it makes sense that most files are around that long.</p>

<p>I think right away, this is a testament to how amazing new-fave is. I’ve worked with legacy data before, and normally there are tons of datapoints in the extreme bottom left of the vowel space. These are the result of formant tracking errors. And that was using the original FAVE! This dataset appears to be <em>remarkably</em> clean, at least when it comes to that.</p>

<section id="normalizing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="normalizing">Normalizing</h3>
<p>Before I look at too much more, I should normalize the data. Fruehwald has <a href="https://jofrhwld.github.io/dct_normalization/#transforming-dct-coefficients">an extremely useful paper</a> on how to use DCT to normalize new-fave output. I’ll read those DCT coefficients after they’ve been log-transformed, which is required when doing the Nearey normalization. I’ll process them in the same way that I did above, except I will keep all vowels.</p>

<p>This produces a dataframe with millions of rows. Intimidating, but I can work with it.</p>
<p>Doing normalization on the DCT coefficients involves jumping over to Python, which is new for me but worth it because of all the reasons Fruehwald explains in his paper. I’ll follow the code he has <a href="https://jofrhwld.github.io/blog/posts/2024/07/2024-07-19_dct-r/">here</a> because this is still new to me, but I’ll try to explain as best I can.</p>
<p>I needed to install the <code>scipy</code> package, so I did that first. I’ll then load it with <code>reticulate::import</code> and then save a particular function within that package into an R object called <code>idct</code>.</p>

<p>I’ll get the average of the DCT parameters by token. I’ll then apply the python function, <code>idct</code> to those averages. With this dataset, I’m working with full trajectory data, not just single points, so the result will be a trajectory. For later analyses, I’ll get average smooths by speaker, but for now, I’ll just collapse all speakers together into averages per allophone.</p>

<p>Looks like a vowel plot! I won’t get into heavy interpretation without further digging into the variation and stuff, but it’s noteworthy how diphthongal and lowered that <sc>bait</sc> vowel is and how monopthongal that <sc>boot</sc> vowel is. It’s also interesting how separated <sc>bot</sc> and <sc>bought</sc> are, but again I’ll have to look at the data more closely to say anything. Keep in mind that this plot is just preobstruent data, so it’s not like that separation is due to prerhotics or prenasals or anything.</p>
<p>Let’s look at my favorite class of allophones: prelaterals. I’ll use the Wells-inspired labels I came up with <a href="../../blog/extending-wells-lexical-sets-to-prelateral-vowels/index.html">in an earlier blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Lots to unpack here, which will undoubtedly happen in future publications. For now, it’s noteworthy that the front vowel pairs <sc>zeal-guilt</sc> and <sc>flail-shelf</sc> are not merged as they are for some Utahns today. The back vowels are interesting. Looks like there might be a <sc>mulch-golf</sc> (that is, /ʌl/-/ɑl/, or <em>dull-doll</em>) merger. And possibly a <sc>jolt-fault</sc> (that is, /ol/-/ɔl/ or <em>hole-hall</em>) merger. Interestingly, <sc>golf</sc> and <sc>fault</sc> are separated, <sc>spool</sc> is not fully backed, and <sc>child</sc> is pretty monophthongal.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at prerhotics.</p>

<p>I anticipated some weirdness here. <sc>Cure</sc> is just weird for lots of reasons because, <a href="../../pages/idiolect/#my-cure-lexical-set">at least for me</a>, it could have lots of different realizations, and I’m assuming that’s true in this dataset too. <sc>Force</sc> and <sc>start</sc> are seemingly straightforward, but there’s actually a lot going on here because of the <em>cord-card</em> merger. I’ve already been analyzing that merger in this dataset, so stay tuned for updates on that.</p>

<p>Anyway, it could take a career to really dive into this data, and I’m happy to finally have something to work with after hearing about it 7½ years ago!</p>

  <title>Simulating Candyland</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>
  <link>https://joeystanley.com/blog/simulating_candyland/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>About six years ago, I did a blog post about how I <a href="../../blog/simulating_chutes_and_ladders">simulated Chutes and Ladders</a> after playing it countless times with my child. Recently, I’ve been playing tons of Candyland with my next child. The games are kinda similar and they take zero skill, which means they’re perfect for little kiddos. It also means I can simulate them pretty easily.</p>
<p>I’m going to base the game off the board that I’ve been playing with, which we got at a thrift store. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/simulating_candyland/board.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-tip callout-titled">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">

<i class="callout-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Tip
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>If you’re not interested in how I did the simulation and just want to see the results, just jump to Section&nbsp;3.</p>
</div>
</div>
<section id="the-simulation" class="level2" data-number="1">
<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-simulation"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> The simulation</h2>

<h3 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setting-up-the-game"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Setting up the game</h3>
<p>The first step in simulating Candyland is to set up the board. There’s no real easy way to do that, so I just went through and hard-coded the tiles and colors. I’ve got a simple dataframe with a column for the tile number, the color of the tile, and if there’s anything special about it. In my original spreadsheet, if there was nothing special about the tile, I left it blank, but because of issues with <code>NA</code>s down the road, I’ve replaced those blank cells with <code>"none"</code>. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p>Now that we’ve got the board, we need to get the cards. This one is actually straightforward enough that I can create it on the fly. First, I’ll create the seven candy cards. I’m not sure if these are the official names, but that’s what we call them in my house.</p>

<p>There are six “single-color” cards four “double-color” cards for each color. So, I’ve first created a function that takes in a color name and creates those ten cards as a vector.</p>

<p>So, with the board and cards set up, let’s start simulating some games. Note that because there is virtually zero interaction between the players, I’m just going to simulate single-player games.</p>

<p>First, I want to allocate space for a full game. First, I’ll create a tibble called <code>turns</code> that has as many rows as twice the number of cards in the deck. After doing some simulations, I’ve found that, very rarely, a single player can get through all the cards and will need to shuffle them. I haven’t yet run into a simulation where a second shuffle is needed, though I suppose it could theoretically go on forever I think.</p>
<p>I’ll then simulate shuffling the cards by randomly sorting the cards with <code>sample(cards, replace = FALSE)</code>. And I’ll string—not shuffle—two decks together in case we have a really long game. I’ll do that by just doing that <code>sample(...)</code> two times and strung together with <code>c()</code>.</p>
<p>As additional columns in this tibble, I’ll create empty columns for the start time number, the end tile number, whether that tile was a shortcut or not. Those will be populated as the game happens.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve got the cards shuffled and ready to go for this game, let’s start the turns. Since I don’t know how many iterations I’ll need, I’ll set up a <code>while</code> loop that goes until I tell it to stop.<sup>1</sup> Here’s what the barebones loop looks like:</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;There might be a more elegant way using <code>for</code> loop. Maybe my R looping skills aren’t where they need to be, but I just couldn’t figure out how to get it to exit the loop the way I wanted to and return the dataframe. I’ve hacked a bit of a solution by incrementing <code>i</code> each iteration. I miss Perl’s <code>last</code> function which made it so that it would exit the loop at the end of the current iteration, not necessarily right at that moment like R’s <code>break</code> function does. The <code>keep_playing</code> variable simulates that.</p></div></div><div class="cell">

<p>Of course, this is going to run forever because we haven’t put in any for it to stop. So I’ll increment <code>i</code> each iteration and end the loop after <code>n_cards*2</code> iterations.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adding-candy-cards"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Adding candy cards</h3>
<p>What we do need to do though is “draw a card” and figure out how many tiles we need to advance. Keep in mind that the cards are already there for us, so we don’t need to randomly sample from the deck or anything. We just need to take the info that’s already there and use it to figure out where to end up.</p>
<p>First, let’s account for the candy cards. These are easy: regardless of what your start tile is, your end tile will always be the same. The code that I’ll add looks like this:</p>

<p>So here, I’m checking to see if the name of the card that has been assigned for this turn matches the one of the candy cards I have saved in the <code>candy_cards</code> vector I declared earlier. If there’s a match, then I’ll basically look up the tile of that candy card in my <code>board</code> dataframe—that’s the one I manually created in a separate file. It searches for the name of the candy, and fetches the tile number for it. That number is then assigned to this turn’s end tile. Here’s that code in context:</p>

<p>So far, the game does nothing unless you run into a candy card. If you do, it’ll note where the end position should be.</p>
<p>At this point, I might as well add some code in that makes it so that the start tile of the next turn is the previous tile of the last turn.</p>

<p>So in the above game, we see that we got candy tiles in two of the first couple turns. The end position is saved and the start position of the next turn is the same.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adding-other-cards"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Adding other cards</h3>
<p>Adding the colored cards is slightly less straightforward than the candy cards, but still isn’t too bad. There are two kinds of cards for each color: single cards, which means you advance to the next tile of that color, and double cards, which means you advance to to the second next tile of that color. Keep in mind that the cards have already been shuffled and assigned turns, so all I need to do is take the card and figure out how far I need to get.</p>
<p>So, right now, the cards take the form of a character vector with values like <code>"single red"</code> or <code>"double blue"</code>. To extract the color, I’ll use <code>str_extract</code> and pull out the last word. And to get whether it’s a single or double, I’ll do the same thing and pull out the first word.</p>

<p>Now, I need to figure out where to go then. I’m less concerned about figuring out the exact number of tiles I need to advance. I think it’ll be easier to select all upcoming tiles of that color and find the tile number of the first or second one. So, first, I’ll create <code>eligible_spots</code>, which takes the board, filters it so that only tiles greater than the tile I’m on and whose color matches the card I drew, and pull out just the tile numbers. So if my starting position were 0 and I drew a single red, here are the eligible spots.</p>

<p>Except, if you’re like me, then the loop breaks. After digging around, I found out that the game works perfectly until the end. So let’s add some better code to account for the end.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ending-the-game"><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Ending the game</h3>
<p>Candyland ends when someone reaches the end of the board. The problem with how our loop works now is that if you’re close to the end and there are no more eligible tiles left, it crashes because it doesn’t know where to go. So, what we need to do is add a conditional that says if there are no more eligible tiles, to move it to “tile 133”, which is just one space after the last tile. We also need to account for the possibility of getting a double when there’s just one eligible tile left, which causes the person to win. So let’s program that in. That updated block of code looks like this:</p>

<p>Once we hit the end of the board, we should end the game. As is, the loop will continue drawing cards until we’ve gone through the deck twice. This may seem like innocent extra iterations of the loop, but the problem is that when we draw another candy card we get pulled back into the game.</p>
<p>So, let’s add some code at the end that says to end the game we’re on tile 133. That means we’ll extend that <code>if-else</code> statement at the bottom of the loop:</p>

<p>Now, the game ends when we run out of cards (programmed as going through the deck twice) or we hit the end of the board. We tell the program that the game is over by setting <code>keep_going</code> to <code>FALSE</code>. That’ll stop the <code>while</code> loop from doing any more iterations.

<p>Because we’ve allocated room in our <code>turns</code> dataframe for many more turns, what you’ll see if you scroll down to the bottom is a bunch of <code>NA</code>s in the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> tiles. We’ll filter those out later. But first, we have to add one more component to the game: the shortcuts!</p>

<h3 data-number="2.7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adding-shortcuts"><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> Adding shortcuts</h3>
<p>The shortcuts are pretty easy to program. In fact, they’re the same as what I did for Chutes and Ladders. We add a conditional that says if the end tile is a certain number, change it to another number. Since there are only two, I’ll just hard-code it in. Here’s what that bit of code looks like.</p>

<p>In order to keep track of which shortcuts were encountered, I added a small bit of code that saves the name of the shortcut to the <code>shortcut</code> column. That’ll come in handy later when we do lots of games and query the simulations.</p>
<p>Now our code is complete:</p>

<p>So, we now have a loop that does a full simulation of Candyland!</p>
<p>But, if you’re like me, just one simulation isn’t enough. I want to run <em>lots</em> of simulations! And since we’ve got this nice and tidy, might as well do just a little bit more and wrap it up into a function! Let’s do that now.</p>
</section>
<section id="wrap-it-up-into-a-function" class="level3" data-number="2.8">
<h3 data-number="2.8" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wrap-it-up-into-a-function"><span class="header-section-number">2.8</span> Wrap it up into a function</h3>
<p>Turning this into a function is actually pretty straightforward from here. All we need to do is put this entire chunk of code into a function and then make sure we’re exporting the final dataset. Here’s where I’ll filter out the <code>NA</code> turns at the end of the game. I’ve also added the argument <code>game_num = 0</code> to the function call, mostly to help with the <code>map</code> function later on, since I can’t figure out how to <code>map</code> through a list without sending an argument.</p>

<p>We can now call <code>simulate_game()</code> as many times as we want, and it’ll do a new simulation each time. Let’s set up a dataframe so that we can save the output of each game. Here, I’ll create a dataframe that has one column called <code>game_num</code> that is just the numbers 1 to 10,000. I’ll then use <code>purrr::map</code> to run the simulation once for each row. This takes about 1.8 minutes on my computer, so be patient if it’s a little slow for you. (Or just decrease the number of games.)</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, when I have code blocks that I know will take a long time to run, I wrap them up in some code to track the time, so I can remember that next time I run. I also add <code>beepr::beep()</code> to the bottom so that my computer makes a satisfying sound once the block is completed. I’ll also set the seed to today’s date to make all this replicable. You can do this if you want, but you obviously don’t need to.</p>

<p>Hooray! We now have a function that simulates an entire game of Candyland, and with just a few additional lines of code and a little bit of patience, we were able to run that simulation thousands of times. Let’s take a look at the output, just to see what we’re working with:</p>

<p>We’ve got the same five columns that we’ve been used to working with, with the addition of one more, showing the game number. In total, there were 218,035 turns taken across these 10,000 games. So, you might be able to see where this is going: we can now query this giant spreadsheet to see patterns across the games.</p>

<p>So, now that we have the simulation done, let’s take a look at the results! First, I’ll take the giant <code>games</code> object and summarize it. I don’t necessarily need to keep information about every single turn, but I can start to count some things that we can think about analyzing later. For now, Ill count the number of turns, candies, singles, doubles, and shortcuts, and I’ll do so by game.</p>

<p>This is an interesting distribution. I’ll bet a statistician could identify what kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution">probability distribution</a> it looks like but it’s not one that I recognize. Broadly, we see that the typical number of turns is about 12–22. There’s an interesting double peak at the top there, one at around 13–14 turns and another centered around 20. I’m not sure what’s going on there, but it seems to show up every time I run these simulations, so there must be something real that is causing that distribution. (Edit: I found out what’s happening! See Section&nbsp;4.2!)</p>
<p>The number of a games that had more than about 22 turns goes down the more turns there were. It follows a nice (reverse?) exponential function. Keep in mind that there are 67 cards in the deck, which appears to be about the limit. There were a small number of games (just 28 out of 10,000) that took more than 67 turns. So, if you’re playing a solo game and have to reshuffle the deck, that’s a pretty rare thing!</p>
<p>The most number of turns I saw in this simulation was a whopping 114. It was an unfortunate sequence of going for a long time without getting any candy cards (or getting ones that were close to where they already were), nearly making it to the end, and then getting yanked back to close to the beginning. It happened over and over. There was one exciting set of turns (about 60 turns in) where they got four candies in just 10 turns. They were right near the end, got the beloved Chocolate Truffle and moved ahead six tiles, then immediately got pulled back to the Lollipop, made it a few turns and then when the deck reshuffled they got pulled back by the Gummy Star, and three turns later pulled back again to the Cupcake.</p>
<p>The fewest number of turns was three, which happened 38 times in my 10,000 games. My five-year-old had this happen to him just the other day—I didn’t realize there was a 0.38% chance of that happening!<sup>2</sup> In all cases, these three-turn games got the Chocolate Truffle on their first turn, and at least one double-color card after that.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Again, a statistician could probably figure out the precise probability, but I figure these numbers based on the simulation are close.</p></div></div></section>

<p>Because they’re the most common kind of card, it should come as no surprise that the distribution of the number of single-color cards you draw parallels the total number of cards drawn in the came. We a hint of that mysterious double peak like we saw in the previous plot, but the first peak is more prominent instead of the second. Overall though, the general shape is the same as the number of turns in the game, only this time it peaks at around 9 rather than 20.</p>
<p>47 games saw zero single-color cards. Most of these involved drawing the Chocolate Truffle or Popsicle on the first turn and then getting two or three double-color cards until the end. A few got some double-candy cards, and then draw one of those candies and then continued to get doubles. Three games got some other candy card (or two) and otherwise “legitimately” made it across the board with just the double-color cards.</p>

<p>This distribution is starting to look familiar now. The most likely outcome is that you’ll see roughly 5–10 double-color cards per game. A few games saw far more, more than 20 or even 25, but the odds of that are quite low. Like the single-color cards, there were a few games that saw no double-color cards. Most of those got a candy pretty early on and then finished the game without seeing any singles.</p>

<p>There are two shortcuts in the game: the peppermint pass, which is available right at the start of the game and takes you ahead about a third of the way, and the gummy pass, which is a short pass again towards the beginning of the game. How many shortcuts are typically seen in a game?</p>

<p>This figure shows that most of the time, about 73.4%, you’re not going to see a shortcut. About 25.2% of games saw one shortcut.</p>
<p>Interestingly, you can’t take both shortcuts without a candy card taking you back close to the beginning because the Peppermint Pass starts before and ends after the Gummy Pass. So, you need to get the Cupcake or Ice Cream Cone to bring you back. And even then, you’d only be able to take the Gummy Pass because once you’ve passed the beginning of the Peppermint Pass, there’s no chance of it again. Nevertheless, 1.35% of games took two shortcuts. In about 60.4% of those cases, the first shortcut was the Gummy Pass.</p>
<p>In two cases (just 0.02% of the time!), there were three shortcuts taken in a single game! In one case, they took the Gummy Pass three times. They got it their first time passing through, again after getting the Cupcake, and again after getting the Ice Cream Cone. In the other case, they took the Peppermint Pass the first time, and then again hit the Gummy Pass after getting the Cupcake and again after getting the Ice Cream Cone.</p>
<p>Three is the maximum unless you go through the deck a second time. But given how rare that happens, the odds of getting three shortcuts, going through the entire deck, and then getting either the Cupcake or Ice Cream Cone and getting the Gummy Pass yet again, is so slim. But not impossible!</p>
<p>Finally, what are the relative odds of the two shortcuts in relation to each other? Surprisingly, the Peppermint Pass is not as rare as I thought. Of all the shortcuts taken, it made up 41% of them. So, the Gummy Pass is about 1.4 times as likely. (I thought that number would be a lot higher!)</p>

<p>Now let’s look at the number of candy cards that a person might encounter in a typical game of Candyland. Right now, we’re not so much concerned about which card but rather just the total number they see. This plot shows the distribution across the simulated games. I’ve added percentages at the top because we had some <em>very</em> small bars towards the right of the plot.</p>

<p>So, it looks like in about 91–92% of games, you’ll draw at least one candy card. The most typical outcome was just one card, but drawing up to four was not too uncommon. The most I saw in my simulations was drawing 13 cards, but that happened exactly one time. Keep in mind that there are only seven candy cards in the deck, so drawing that many would involve getting through the entire deck without finishing, and then drawing six of the seven cards <em>again</em> before finishing. In fact just 0.1% of games draw eight or more, meaning they went through the entire deck.</p>
<p>But that’s if we’re considering all the candy cards collectively. Let’s take a look at the candy cards individually to see if they have their own patterns.</p>

<p>You would expect the candies to be pretty evenly distributed, and they are pretty close. However, there is more variation between the cards than I expected. I’ve overlayed a gray dashed line at 14.28% (one-seventh), showing what the expected height of each bar would be if they were all drawn evenly. Some of these are a bit higher and lower than I expected. The Cupcake, for example, was drawn 16.34% of the time—just about a full 1% more than expected—and the ice cream code and Lollipop were drawn 13.01% of the time, more than 1% lower than expected.</p>
<p>You might be thinking, “Who cares? 1% is basically nothing. It’s just random chance.” I’m not so sure. Here’s what the distribution would be if it were truly random, plotted on the same scale as the above plot. I’ve randomly chosen a number between one and seven 10,000 times and plot them:</p>

<p>These numbers are all much closer to the predicted value of 14.28%. None are further than 0.6% away. You might be thinking, “Okay, so you got lucky one time. The deviance observed in the candy cards is well within the range of possible values.” But still, I don’t think it is! I did the above experiment—pick a number between one and seven 10,000 times and then get the proportions of each number—itself 10,000 times. So I have 100 million data points. Below, I’ve plotted the distribution of those proportions from the 10,0000 experiments (where each experiment had 10,000 random draws).</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, those seven distributions are basically identical. Their means are 0.14285 ± 0.000041 and their standard deviations are 0.003489 ± .0000343. I’ll therefore collapse the seven numbers together and treat them as a single distribution. That’s visualized below with the means of each of the candy cards.</p>

<p>One candy card (the Gummy Star) is well within the expected range. The Popsicle is on the edge of the distribution, but still a plausible value. But the Cupcake was so far away from the expected value. The <em>z</em>-score was 5.688 and the <em>p</em>-value is about 0.0000001. So the odds of getting these cards as infrequently as we did, assuming they’re evenly probable, is quite small. I have no explanation for why that is, but I think it’s an intriguing finding here. It’s also intriguing that the Ice Cream Cone and the Lollipop are consistently drawn at around the same rate, and far lower than expected.</p>
<p>Finally, when I did this whole thing again based on a different random seed, I got strikingly similar results. There’s something here and I’m not sure what it is!</p>

<p>One of the biggest questions I have as to do with the candy cards still. It’s often the case that when you get a candy card, it’s an exciting thing because you jump ahead a lot. But, it also seems like a lot of the time it’s a bad thing because you fall back quite a bit.<sup>3</sup> So, is it overall better to get a candy card, or is it on average worse for your game?</p>

<p>Okay, so there’s a lot to unpack here. First off, we see that it’s centered right around zero with similar-looking distributions on either sides. The biggest jumps ahead were when a Chocolate Truffle was drawn right at the beginning of the game. The biggest fallbacks were when the Cupcake was drawn just before the end of the game. The dreaded scenario of drawing a Cupcake while sitting on the last tile happened 24 times!</p>
<p>The next thing I see in this plot is a few random spikes on the right side of the plot. Those are cases where you draw a candy right right at the start of the game.</p>
<p>Overall, the average number of tiles advanced across all these candy car draws was 1.26, with a median of 5. If we ignore the first turn of each game (since that seems to have caused those spikes), the average drops to -1.62 and the median is just 2 tiles. So, candy cards are sometimes good and sometimes bad, but overall it really is just a wash.</p>

<p>The patterns here make a lot of sense. First, there are 11 tiles that are about twice as high. Seven of those are candy tiles and two of them are the ends of the shortcuts. It makes sense why the ends of the shortcuts are twice as high because you’ve got twice the odds of landing on them: once from taking the shortcut and once by approaching the end point the long way. The candy tiles are twice as high because they’re about as likely as taking the shortcuts.</p>
<p>You’ll also notice two tiles that were never landed on. Those are the beginning of the shortcuts. So, technically you do land on them, but you don’t <em>end your turn</em> on them.</p>
<p>The other two tiles that are landed on the most are two yellow tiles right at the end of the game. Why would those be landed on more than other tiles? As it turns out, I think it’s an error in how the game is laid out. Normally, when a candy tile is placed, it interrupts the sequence of colors across the board. However, in the case of the Chocolate Truffle, it actually takes the place of a yellow tile. Normally, if you’re within six tiles of a yellow tile (or any color), and draw a single color, you’ll land on that. But because that yellow was skipped, now if you’re within 12 tiles of that penultimate yellow, you’ll land there. And if you’re further back and get a double yellow, you’ll land there. So, the odds are just twice as greater because a yellow tile was skipped. That very last spike towards the end is the subsequent yellow, which you’d get if you drew a double yellow within five tiles of the Chocolate Truffle (on either side).</p>

<p>The other kind of intriguing pattern is that the number of times a tile is landed on decreases the further away one gets from a candy and shortcut tile. Since those tiles are the most likely, it makes sense then that the tiles immediately following them are more common. The further away you get from them though, the odds go up that you’ll see another candy card or something, pulling you away from that part of the board. The gap between tile 20 (Ice Cream Cone) and 41 (the end of the Gummy Pass followed by the Gummy Star) and the gap between tile 69 (Gingerbread Man) and 92 (Lollipop) show this especially well.</p>

<p>So, so far we’ve seen a lot of patterns in Candyland based on 10,000 simulated solo games. Most of the results are not too surprising, but it’s nice to put some numbers to things, like the number turns it takes, how many candy cards you’re likely to draw, whether candy cards are ultimately good or bad for your game, and how much more common one shortcut is compared to the other.</p>

<p>Since we’ve got this all simulated, I can actually pretty easily change a few things about the game to see what kind of effect it might have on the results. I did this last time with my simulation of <a href="../../blog/simulating_chutes_and_ladders">Chutes and Ladders</a> and found that if you remove the longest chute, sure enough the average game length was shorter. What kinds of changes can we make to Candyland?</p>

<p>I think it would be fun to add one triple-color card for each color in the deck. It’d be a rare but really cool thing to encounter. Let’s add those six cards to the deck and see what happens to the stats.</p>

<p>There are only six triples in the deck, so it’s unsurprising that there are relatively few drawn in a game. But most games encountered at least one, just like the candy cards. Let’s see what overall effect this hand on the number of turns in the game.</p>

<p>So, unsurprisingly, the overall number of turns it takes to complete a game of Candyland goes down if you add some triple-color cards. Interestingly, the most likely outcome is still to finish in about 12–20 turns. But, you’re a little more likely to finish in that range, you’re more likely to finish in fewer turns than that, and less likely to finish in more terns.</p>
<p>So, if the creators wanted to change the game a little bit, they could tweak the deck and run some simulations. If they feel the game is too long, add some more doubles or triples. If it’s too short, add more singles.</p>

<p>We’ve established in Section&nbsp;3.6 that the candy cards ultimately don’t benefit the player if the only objective is to finish the game. They are, of course, the most fun part of the game. (My family’s Chocolate Truffle card is starting to fall apart because my kids like to hold it so much!) But, what would happen if we took those cards out entirely? How would that affect the length of the game?</p>

<p>These results surprised me! I thought that because candy cards, on average, don’t help the player advance that much, that the number of turns required to finish a game would be basically the same. I was prepared to make the conclusion that while they don’t help advance the game, they certainly make it more fun. I was wrong! Well, kinda. They’re still fun regardless, but taking out the candy cards has several effects.</p>
<p>First, the minimum number of turns it takes to finish the game goes up. The shortest game took just eight turns. In all four that this happened, the simulation got six double-color cards <em>and</em> the peppermint pass. This makes sense because you have to work your way across the entire board “the long way.”</p>
<p>Second, the longest game is considerably shorter. This also makes sense because every turn brings you closer to the end and there’s nothing pulling you back. You might think the longest game in theory would be 133 turns because that’s how many tiles there are, but you’d have to start drawing double cards at some point, so it’d have to be shorter. In these 10,000 simulations, the longest game took 32 turns. There’s nothing special about it other than they just got crummy luck. Many of their single cards advanced them just two or three tiles, and several of their doubles advanced them just seven or eight tiles.</p>
<p>The combined effects of lengthening the shortest game and shortening the longest game means that the variability in number of turns needed to finish the game goes down. This is visually apparent in the plot: there’s a tighter cluster centered around 21–22 games, rather than the much more spread out distribution in a regular game.</p>
<p>The final effect that I see is a greater exaggeration of the bimodal distribution. In Section&nbsp;3.1, I pointed out there was a spike around 13–14 turns and another around 20. We see those same numbers, maybe shifted slightly, but in a much more stark way. It’s really hard to pick out what’s going on here, but I think the obvious answer is that the games that took a shortcut took fewer turns. I mean, of course taking a shortcut will make the whole game shorter, but is the effect as strong as it seems?</p>
<p>It seems so. I classified the games based on whether they finished in 15 turns or less and whether they took the Peppermint Pass (the really good shortcut at the beginning of the game). Sure enough, 95% of games that took that shortcut also finished in 15 turns or less, and 98% of games that did <em>not</em> take the shortcut finished the game in more than 15 turns.<sup>4</sup> When I plot the data split up by whether the peppermint pass was taken, the pattern is crystal clear.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn4"><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;I ran a chi-squared on this data and it supports the idea of a relationship between these two categories (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cchi%5E2"> = 159,941.1, df = 1, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.0001). I’m not really sure if chi-squared tests work with such large numbers, but the results are so clear in just the summary that stats aren’t needed to show the pattern.</p></div></div><div class="cell">

<p>So, going back to the original data plotted in Section&nbsp;3.1, I’ll bet that’s what’s going on. It’s not as clear of a pattern in a real game because it mostly gets washed out from the candies, but I’ll bet that’s what’s going on. Let me plot that original data again just to make sure.</p>

<p>Yep, there it is. So, that bimodal distribution is because of the peppermint pass. Pretty cool.</p>

<p>Okay, so I had some fun with this. Simulating Candyland is pretty straightforward, and once you’ve got it going, it’s easy to query and see patterns. And it’s easy to make some adjustments and see what kind of effect it has on the gameplay.</p>
<p>Here’s a summary of the main findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>The typical number of turns to finish a game is 10–25, more on the lower end if you take the Peppermint Pass and more on the upper end if you don’t.</li>
<li>It’s typical to see 5–15 single-color cards and 3-10 double cards.</li>
<li>Only about a third of games take one of the shortcuts, and the Gummy Pass is 1.4 times as likely as the Peppermint Pass.</li>
<li>You’ll see at least one candy card in 90% of games. For some inexplicable reason, the Cupcake and Chocolate Truffle are far more common than due to random chance alone, and the Lollipop, Ice Cream Cone, and Gingerbread Man are far less common.</li>
<li>The candy cards are, overall, neither an advantage nor a disadvantage. If you remove candy cards drawn on the first turn, the average number of tiles advanced because of a candy card is basically zero.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this tutorial, I’ll walk you through how to use OpenAI’s Whisper model to automatically transcribe your audio completely within R. We’ll do so using the <a href="https://github.com/bnosac/audio.whisper"><code>audio.whisper</code></a> pacakge.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/bnosac/audio.whisper">R package</a> for Whisper is only available through a third-party company called <a href="http://www.bnosac.be">BNOSAC</a>, rather than through OpenAI itself. From what I can tell, it is more limited in its capabilities than <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper">OpenAI’s own Python package</a>. Since I have never really learned Python programming, I’ll stick with R.</p>

<p>The first step is to install <a href="https://github.com/bnosac/audio.whisper"><code>audio.whisper</code></a>. Since it’s not available through R’s official repository for R packages, we won’t be able to just use <code>install.packages</code> like normal. Instead, we’ll use the <code>install_github</code> function, which is available in a package called <code>devtools</code>. <sup>1</sup> You’ll need to specify the path <code>"bnosac/audio.whisper"</code>, which let’s R know <a href="https://github.com/bnosac/audio.whisper">where on GitHub</a> the package is located. We add <code>ref = "0.3.3"</code> as an argument to the installation function to ensure that we’re getting the latest <em>stable</em> version of the package. Without it, you’ll get the latest <em>development</em> version which may be buggy and not work for you.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;If you don’t have <code>devtools</code> already, you can install it the normal way: <code>install.packages("devtools")</code>.</p></div></div><div class="cell">

</div>
<p>Now that you’ve got the R package installed, you’ll need to actually download the Whisper model to your computer, so that Whisper can function completely offline. There are different sizes of the model, ranging from tiny to <code>large-v3</code>. The smaller ones will get transcription done quicker and take up less room on your computer, but they may not be as accurate. The larger models will take longer to do and will take up more room on your computer, but they will be more accurate. On my computer (a 2023 MacBook Pro), I’ve only been able to get the “small” model to work. Anything larger fails on my computer, possibly because of a lack of processing power. I have transcribed lab quality speech with pretty good results using the small model. A student of mine compared the output to the medium model and found it to be raelly not that much improved over the small model, even though it took more than twice as long. So, for my purposes (and possibly yours too), the small model may be all you need.</p>
<p>Here are the options and the code for each one. We’ll load it using the function <code>whisper</code> and save the output to an object called <code>model</code>. We’ll call that object later on.</p>

<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-whisper"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Using Whisper</h2>
<p>Using Whisper really only takes a few lines of code. So if you’re interested in just a one-off use, then you’re in luck. I’ll first show the bare minimum you’ll need to use Whisper. However, be aware that the output isn’t in a particularly useful format, so you’ll likely need to convert it to a TextGrid, which we can do right here as well. And of course, wrapping it all into a function can help if you need to process multiple files.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is convert the audio to a 16-bit WAV file. This is a constraint imposed by <code>audio.whisper</code> (and maybe Whisper itself, I don’t know). We can do this with the <code>av_audio_convert</code> function in the <code>av</code> package. This function takes four arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>the pathname to the audio you want to convert</li>
<li>the pathname to the output you want to convert</li>
<li>the format you want to convert the audio to</li>
<li>the sample rate you want to convert the audio to.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a file named <code>02-Carol.wav</code> that I’m going to use for this tutorial.<sup>3</sup> It’s a 1-minute snippet from a sociolinguistic interview I did as part of my dissertation in Washington where she talks about what it was like living near Mount St.&nbsp;Helens when it erupted in 1980. The file is already in the right format, but I’ll run the code anyway just to be sure.</p>

<p>Note that putting just the filename (i.e.&nbsp;<code>"02-Carol.wav"</code>) assumes that the file is in the same folder as the script that you’re running this code from. If your file lives somewhere else on your computer, you’ll need to provide a full path (e.g.&nbsp;<code>"/Users/joeystan/Desktop/dissertation/audio/02-Carol/02-Carol.wav</code>) or a relative path (e.g.&nbsp;<code>"../audio/02-Carol.wav"</code>).</p>

<p>I’ve now created a new file called <code>02-Carol.wav_16bit.wav</code>. That one should be ready to process. We’ll now use the <code>predict</code> function in <code>audio.whisper</code> to actually run Whisper on that newly created audio file. There are four arguments here.</p>
<ul>
<li>first, <code>model</code>, or the name of the object you created when you loaded the model above</li>
<li><code>newdate</code>: the path to the 16-bit WAV file you want to process</li>
<li><code>language</code>: the language of the audio being transcribed</li>
<li><code>n_threads</code>: the number of cores in your computer you want to devote towards the task. This is not optional, but since many computers nowadays have mutliple cores, you can speed up the task by having the function run in parallel across multiple cores. You can check how many cores you have by running <code>parallel::detectCores()</code> after installing the <code>parallel</code> package. Mine has 12.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll run that function and save that transcription to an object called <code>trans</code>.</p>

13                                The kids were really little.
14                       We had kind of slept in that morning.
15        Kind of taken a slow pace, getting ready for church.
16          And my dad, who lived about 10 miles north of here
17                 and had a view, he couldn't actually see it
18              but he could see the plume come up, called us.
19                      And he said, "The mountain just blew."</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Okay, but now we need to get it into a format that’s actually useful. Right now it’s saved basically as a data frame (<code>trans$data</code>). Unfortunately, if you want to do subsequent processing, like forced alignment or extracting acoustic measurements, you’ll need to convert this output into a different format.</p>

<h2 data-number="3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-elan-to-convert-to-a-praat-textgrid"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Using ELAN to convert to a Praat TextGrid</h2>
<p>If you’re just doing a small number of files, the easiest way to go would probably be to open this file in ELAN and from there export it into a Praat TextGrid. Let’s walk through that.</p>
<p>First, let’s export the file. Normally, I like doing a comma-separated value (.csv) file, but because Whisper automatically punctuates the transcription, which includes commas, it throws off how .csv files are stored. Instead, I’ll export it as a .txt file, and separate columns with tabs, which are coded in R as <code>\t</code>. I’ll do this using <code>write_delim</code>, which is part of <code>tidyverse</code>. There are three arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The file you want to export. That’s <code>trans$data</code>.</li>
<li>The name and path of the file you want to create.</li>
<li><code>delim = "\t"</code>, which tells R to put tabs between columns.</li>
</ul>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb11" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb11-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

font-style: inherit;">"trans.txt"</span>, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">delim =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"</span><span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">\t</span><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>The result is a new file that looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/whisper/trans_screenshot.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>OKay, so now we need to jump over to the ELAN software. ELAN is an annotation tool for audio and video and is used by linguists all over the world. You can download it <a href="https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan/download">here</a>. I’m not going to explain much more because it’s pretty tangential to what this tutorial is about. All you need to know is that it’s great and that it can convert one transcription format to another, a fact we’ll take advantage of now.</p>
<p>Let’s open up ELAN. Here’s what the window looks like when you first open it.</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/whisper/elan_basic.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Go to File &gt; Import &gt; CSV/Tab-delimited Text File and open the new <code>trans.txt</code> file (or whatever you called it) that you just created. You’ll then be presented with a window that will give you some options for how ELAN should read the file in. Here’s what you’ll need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Towards the bottom of the file, specify that the delimiter is a Tab. That’ll change how the rest of the window looks.</li>
<li>In the middle of the window (in the “Import options” portion), uncheck the box under 1. That corresponds to the first column of the exported dataframe which is just sequentially numbering the intervals. Not super useful to us.</li>
<li>For column 2, change it to “Begin Time”. This corresponds to the start of each interval.</li>
<li>For column 3, change it to “End Time”. This corresponds to the end of each interval.</li>
<li>For column 4, change it to “Annotation”. This corresponds to the actual transcription.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/whisper/elan_settings.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Once you’ve done that, the transcription should be loaded like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/whisper/elan_loaded.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We don’t really need to do anything in ELAN other than one small change. Currently, the tier is called “Tier-0”, which you can see in red text towards the bottom left of the window. Let’s change that to something more meaningful to us. Go to Tier &gt; Change Tier Attributes…. In the center of the new window that pops up, change the tier name to whatever you want, then hit “Change”. I’ll change it to “sentence” so that if I want to send it off to <a href="http://darla.dartmouth.edu">DARLA</a> (see tutorial <a href="../../blog/darla/">here</a>), I can do so without any other changes.</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/whisper/elan_changetiername.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Now you can simply export it into a Praat TextGrid. Go to File &gt; Export As &gt; Praat TextGrid…. You can use the default settings that show up in that export window, navigate to a location that is convenient for you, give it a name (be sure it has <code>.TextGrid</code> at the end of the filename), and save it with UTF-8 encoding.</p>
<p>Congrats! You now have a Praat TextGrid of an automatically generated transcription using Whisper.</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/whisper/elan_praat.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Now, there are a few things you need to be aware of. First, Whisper is going to assume that there’s only one speaker. If there are multiple speakers in your audio, you’ll need to modify the TextGrid and separate those out. It’s out of the scope of this tutorial to show how to do that, but you can look at <a href="https://joeystanley.com/downloads/190911-intro_to_Praat.html">my tutorial on Praat</a> for some basic, general advice on how to work with TextGrids. You’ll have to just listen to the audio and move any speech from, say, the interviewer, to a new tier.</p>
<p>The other thing that you should be aware of is that for some reason the TextGrid goes for five minutes, even if the audio is not that long. In my case, the audio is only about a minute, but you’ll notice that the TextGrid goes to 300 seconds. That bug must have been introduced in ELAN because it’s not part of the Whisper output. I don’t think it’ll harm anything, but it’s just something to be aware of.<sup>4</sup></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn4"><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;There may be an easy fix to that, but I rarely use ELAN so I don’t know it well enough to say!</p></div></div><p>Finally, very occasionally, Whisper may introduce a bug in the timing of the intervals such that the end time of one interval is later than the start time of the next interval. I’m not sure why that happens. Praat seems to be able to handle it most of the time, but sometimes it causes Praat to crash. If that happens to you, you’ll need to carefully check <code>trans.txt</code> and make sure each interval’s start time is identical to the previous interval’s end time. If you spot any errors, you can fix them manually.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2" data-number="4">
<h2 data-number="4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hopefully with this brief tutorial, you’re able to start to automatically transcribe your own audio files.</p>
<p>In the future, I’ll expand this post to show how you can do all the Whisper stuff in a more automated way. This will include writing a function that converts the output into a TextGrid right in R so that you don’t have to go through ELAN for every file. All you’ll need to do is provide the name of the audio file and it’ll load it it, create the 16-bit WAV file, do the transcription, and export the TextGrid all at once. You can then start to loop over many files at once. But that tutorial will have to wait until I have a little more time.</p>

  <title>Y Magazine’s Video on my Missionary Voice research</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>
  <link>https://joeystanley.com/blog/missionary-voice-video/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>A couple years ago, Wendy Smemoe, Josh Stevenson, and I did some research on “Missionary Voice”, or the speech register used by missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. After it was was <a href="https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/PLSA/article/view/5701">published</a> last year,<sup>1</sup> my institution, Brigham Young University, apparently thought the research was interesting. So, first, the linguistics department did <a href="https://ling.byu.edu/missionary-voice-real-or-fake/">a write-up</a> in summer 2024. Then, in Fall 2024, <em>Y Magazine</em>, which is sent out to alumni, did <a href="https://magazine.byu.edu/article/missionary-voice-byu-research/">a write-up</a> as well. I just found out this week that a video they produced was posted onto YouTube! I hadn’t seen it before a few people started telling me about it.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;For a more detailed write-up about that paper, see <a href="../../blog/missionary-voice">this earlier blog post</a>.</p></div></div><div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UIcYzTiONRk" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>It was a fun experience to be interviewed about my research like this. Jedidiah Flores of <em>Y Magazine</em> contacted us—I think as a result of the article that Rachel Bowden wrote originally for the department—in July, and we met virtually to talk about our findings. Her article was published in the Fall 2024 issue and online. We then met with the <em>Y Magazine</em> videography team at the end of August to talk about the possibility of making a video, and then in October we filmed the interview itself. <sup>2</sup></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;I remember that was about an hour after getting barbecue for lunch with some friends, so I was really careful to not get sauce on my shirt or food in my teeth!</p></div></div><p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/missionary-voice-video/behind-the-scenes.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>For what it’s worth, the room we were in is the linguistics department’s conference room. While may look like just a room, but I have a lot of memories in there. I took some of my most memorable courses there when I was an undergrad. And my job talk when I applied for a faculty position was not only in that room, but I stood right where the interview took place.</p>
<p>I think they interviewed us for around 45 minutes. I remember just going on and on, not necessarily about the specifics of the findings, but about sociolinguistics generally and its greater implications. So, props to the editors for cutting down so much material into a much shorter video! You see just a glimpse of that larger discussion towards the end of the video. We talk about how it’s important to be aware of language bias and that it’s hard to love and respect other people if you don’t like the way they talk.</p>
<p>Some of you reading this might find the transition to religious topics in the video unusual. We mention a basic Christian tenet that we are all children of God and that Christ taught us to love one another (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p34#p34">John 13:34</a>). This is a church-owned institution and we were encouraged to find ways to unapologetically infuse our research with our religion. I believe our research stands on its own as an interesting sociolinguistic study, independent of religion. But, I also think that knowledge of sociolinguistic principles can make someone a better person because it draws attention to language bias and helps us overcome it.</p>

  <title>A tutorial on using DARLA</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>
  <link>https://joeystanley.com/blog/darla/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This tutorial focuses on DARLA, an online tool to facilitate automatic processing phonetic data, specifically for English vowels.<sup>1</sup> I’ll walk you through the most common use cases, based on my experience using DARLA and what I’ve seen students do. There is more to DARLA than what I can show here, and I encourage you to explore its full capabilities once you’ve mastered the basics.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;This tutorial comes about a decade later than it should have. I hope it can still be of use to new linguistics students.</p></div></div><div class="callout callout-style-default callout-note callout-titled">

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>I am not affiliated with the folks who created or maintain DARLA, but I have been using DARLA since soon after its release in 2015. In grad school, I processed many hundreds of files of all kinds, lengths, and qualities. I don’t know all the inner workings of DARLA, so what I present here is what I’ve been able to gather based on using it a lot.</p>
</div>
</div>
<section id="what-is-darla" class="level2 page-columns page-full" data-number="1">
<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-darla"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> What is DARLA?</h2>
<p>DARLA is a website that has various sociophonetic data processing tools set up in a pipeline so that you can send files through various steps to get acoustic measurements. The various tools it uses are difficult to install for an average person, and even if you do have them on your computer, getting the output of one to feed nicely into the next is sometimes not a trivial task. DARLA does all the hard work of setting up the assembly line for you so that you don’t have to.</p>
<p>DARLA’s ultimate goal is to provide you a spreadsheet of acoustic measurements. Specifically, formant measurements at multiple points along the duration of each vowel in your audio file. Because some of the software that it uses are based on English, it only works on English data. And while some people have had success using DARLA for other varieties of English, you’ll have the best results when working with American English.</p>
<p>There are three main processing steps that need to happen to go from raw audio to a spreadsheet of formant measurements. First is <strong>transcription</strong>. We need to have a sentence- or utterance-level transcription of the audio, with timestamps, in regular English orthography. The timestamps are important. If you think about the closed captioning in a movie, it needs to know when to start showing a particular sentence and when to stop showing it. I suspect there’s a file somewhere under-the-hood of a DVD or streaming service that has a transcription file that has the sentence, the start time and the end time. Unlike closed captioning though, our transcription needs to be in a Praat TextGrid format (see Section&nbsp;7.1 for more details). Regardless of how the transcription is done, it will help in DARLA’s ultimate goal of knowing the start and end points of each vowel in the audio.</p>
<p>Next, is <strong>forced-alignment</strong>. Using a software called the Montreal Forced Aligner (or MFA).<sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup> This takes a sentence-level transcription and ultimately converts it to a word- and phoneme-level transcription. The way it does this is it’ll take every word in the transcription and look it up in a pronunciation dictionary. DARLA uses the <a href="http://darla.dartmouth.edu/cmudict">CMU Dict</a>.<sup>4</sup> It’ll then convert your transcription into a quasi-IPA transcription called ARPABET (see the bottom of <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict">this page</a>). The MFA then goes through its acoustic model, which knows what each speech sound is supposed to look/sound like in an audio file. For each utterance, it then does the best job it can at matching the audio to the string of speech sounds it’s expecting to find. It’s a somewhat complicated process, but you don’t need to fully understand it. The point is, at the end of forced alignment, MFA (and therefore DARLA) will provide you a version of your transcription that has every word and every phoneme aligned with start and end times.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Created by Michael McAuliffe, Michaela Socolof, Sarah Mihuc, Michael Wagner, and Morgan Sonderegger in 2017.</p></div><div id="fn3"><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;You can <a href="https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">install MFA yourself</a>, but it’s not as easy as other software.</p></div><div id="fn4"><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Also available <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict">here</a></p></div></div><p>Finally, we have <strong>formant extraction</strong>. DARLA uses a software called <a href="https://github.com/JoFrhwld/FAVE">FAVE</a> to do this step. FAVE goes through the phoneme-level transcription that MFA provides, and looks at each vowel. For each one, it’ll extract a whole bunch of acoustic measurements and save them into a spreadsheet. In the end FAVE (and therefore DARLA) will provide you with that spreadsheet, which you can use for whatever you want, including processing in Excel or some statistical software.</p>
<p>You can do all these steps yourself manually if you’d like, but as old-school sociophoneticians know, that takes forever. You can also install these pieces of software yourself and do it completely offline if you’d like too, but it takes a bit of computer know-how to get that going. Or, you can upload your files to DARLA and with a few clicks, have it do the hard work of sending it through those three processing steps!</p>

To summarize…
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The main pipeline is transcription → forced alignment (with MFA) → formant extraction (with FAVE). DARLA lets you jump into the pipeline at any point. You can choose to do all three, just the last two, or just the last one. And with transcription and forced alignment, it offers a few options on how to do it.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-this-tutorial-will-work"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> How this tutorial will work</h3>
<p>What do you need in order to use DARLA? Well, it depends on how much automatic work you want to do. For the rest of this tutorial, it’ll be a bit of a choose-your-own-adventure book.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If all you have is an audio file and you want DARLA to do transcription, forced alignment, and formant extraction, go to Section&nbsp;2.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a transcription of your audio, and want to do forced alignment and formant extraction, go to Section&nbsp;3.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a force-aligned transcription of your audio already and all you need to do is run FAVE to get formants, go to Section&nbsp;4.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of where along the pipeline you are, many of the options that DARLA presents to you to customize the processing are the same, so I’ve included Section&nbsp;5, which has further instructions that apply regardless of what method you choose. If you run into trouble, see Section&nbsp;7.</p>

<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-completely_automated"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Completely Automated Vowel Extraction</h2>
<p>If you’ve got an audio file and are excited to get some quick-and-dirty results, you can send it through DARLA’s <a href="http://darla.dartmouth.edu/cave">completely automatic pipeline</a>. This will automatically transcribe your data using one of two speech recognition systems, and then send it off for further processing.</p>
<section id="darlas-in-house-transcription-system" class="level3" data-number="2.1">
<h3 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="darlas-in-house-transcription-system"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> DARLA’s in-house transcription system</h3>
<p>The first of the two methods is DARLA’s <a href="http://darla.dartmouth.edu/uploadasr">in-house speech recognition system</a>. You’ll be presented with this interface, which is typical of all DARLA’s interfaces:</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/darla/automated_inhouse.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>First, it’ll ask you to upload a sound recording. They recommend audio files at least two minutes long, but it will run on slightly shorter files, although I don’t know what kind of effect that has on the output. As for the next thre questions about filters, see Section&nbsp;5.1. Once you’ve filled out that page and hit “submit”, you can jump to Section&nbsp;5.2.</p>
<p>Regarding DARLA’s in-house transcription, <a href="http://darla.dartmouth.edu/about#">they say</a> that it’s not a particularly good model and is really only intended to reliably transcribe the stressed vowel. It’s a model based on 400 hours of speech, but compared to contemporary speech-to-text methods, it doesn’t fare particularly well. They say in <a href="https://aclanthology.org/N15-3015.pdf">their write-up</a> that it has a 42% word-error rate and a 9% stressed vowel error rate once you’ve filtered out some of the bad measurements. If all you’re interested in are average positions of vowel categories, you’re probably okay trying it out, but for anything beyond that and I would start to think about providing your own transcription rather than have DARLA doing it.</p>

My Recommendation

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Only use DARLA’s in-house speech recognition system if you want to get a very rough look at some vowel formants. Don’t rely on it for any serious analysis of vowels.</p>

<p>The other option for completely automated transcription in DARLA is to <a href="http://darla.dartmouth.edu/bedword">use a third-party software called Bed Word</a>. This is a relatively new option (around 2023) and works on more than just English.</p>

<p>Bed Word is the brainchild of Marcus Ma, a then-undergraduate at Georgia Tech. He noticed that there are decent speech-to-text systems out there, but linguists hardly use them because the output they return is in a format that’s not particularly easy for linguists to work with, especially for subsequent acoustic analysis. So, with the help of Lelia Glass (a linguist at Georgia Tech) and Jim Stanford (who maintains DARLA), Ma took the Deepgram model and incorporated it into a pipeline that gives a Praat TextGrid instead of some other format. I had the opportunity to meet Ma and try out Bed Word before it went live and I was impressed with how good it was!</p>
<p>This is not the first time linguists have incorporated third-party transcription models into linguistic analysis pipelines. DARLA used to have another option that involved sending the audio through YouTube’s closed captioning service. And in 2018, linguists at the University of Washington (Alicia Wassink, Rob Squizzero, Campion Fellin, and David Nichols) introduced <a href="https://clox.ling.washington.edu/#/">CLOx</a>, which involved using Microsoft’s speech-to-text system. These let users leverage the power of models created by companies with far more money and resources than what linguists have, but in sort of a backdoor sort of way. The difference here is that Bed Word is incorporated into DARLA, and the output can be sent on to subsequent processing steps all in one go, which makes it even more convenient.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Because Bed Word uses a third-party software, there’s a small bit of work involved when getting started fo the first time. DARLA gives some instructions on how to do this, which will involve creating an account through <a href="https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/introduction">Deepgram</a>. Using Deepgram (and therefore Bed Word) is technically <a href="https://deepgram.com/pricing">not free</a>, but at the time of writing in February 2025, you get $200 of free credit, which is far more than what you’d need if you’re a casual user of DARLA. So, you shouldn’t have to worry about paying for this service.</p>
<p>If you select this option, you’ll see a screen that looks like this:</p>

<p>There are more options than the in-house transcription. I honestly don’t use Bed Word too much, so I can’t offer additional insight into these options other than what DARLA has on that webpage. I encourage you to read through the explanations carefully. The main one you’ll want to pay attention to is the last one. If your data is in English and you want to get formant measurements and a vowel chart, check this box so DARLA will send your files down the rest of the pipeline.</p>

<p>Automated transcription is great, but it introduces errors and uncertainty into your analysis. If you have the time and resources to do so, it is better to provide DARLA a transcription of the audio. There are several ways to do this.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You could transcribe your audio manually using <a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/">Praat</a>, <a href="https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan">ELAN</a>, or some other software. This is very time consuming but it is likely the best option if you are concerned about accuracy. It’s a bit of a rite of passage for some linguists (<a href="../../blog/transcribing-a-sociolinguistic-corpus">here are my thoughts</a> when I finished transcribing my dissertation data) and there’s no better way to really get to know your data than to listen and trascribe every second of it. If you’re doing just one audio file, manual transcription shouldn’t take too long.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don’t have the time or resources to do a full manual transcription, you can try correcting an automatic transcription. There are <em>tons</em> of free or paid transcription services and software that you could use, including <a href="@sec-bedword">Bed Word via DARLA</a>. The problem though is that the output might not be in a format that can be processed by phonetic software like DARLA (i.e.&nbsp;a Praat TextGrid). And if the automatic transcription is not very good, you might spend just as much time correcting as you would have just transcribing it yourself.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of how you get your transcriptions, in order to use the semi-automated option in DARLA, you’ll need a transcription of your audio file. The format of that transcription will determine which option you use.</p>

<p>Probably the most typical way of using DARLA is to provide it with a transcription in the form of a Praat TextGrid.<sup>5</sup> This is the method recommended by DARLA. Here are the instructions that DARLA provides when prepping your TextGrid.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn5"><p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;It is beyond the scope of this tutorial to explain what a TextGrid is or how to prepare one.

<h3 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-plaintext-file"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> A plaintext file</h3>
<p>The alternative to using a TextGrid is to upload your transcription as a “plaintext” file. If you’re not even sure what this means, here’s what that would look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/darla/plaintext_example.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>It’s not pretty, but the content is all there. It’s kind of like a TextGrid transcription but without any timestamps. You might get this if you use a third-party transcription service that does not have linguistic data processing in mind.</p>
<p>DARLA has some instructions on how to prepare for this method, which involves removing extraneous noise from the audio file itself:</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/darla/plaintext_option.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The last tip references the “smart replace” option (or something similar) that a lot of word processors have. See Section&nbsp;7.1, specifically the part about curly quotes, to get a little more clarification on what that means.</p>
<p>The interface for this looks simliar to what was seen with the TextGrid transcriptions. Simply upload your audio and transcription file. See Section&nbsp;5.1 for what to do about the filtering options and see Section&nbsp;5.2 for what to do once you hit the “submit” button.</p>
<p>I don’t recommend this option for a few reasons. DARLA has to work harder to get an accurate transcription. With a sentence- or utterance-level transcription, DARLA only needs to scan a few seconds of speech and match up a few dozen speech sounds to the audio. With a transcription like this without timestamps, DARLA has to scan the entire audio file and look through hundreds or thousands of speech sounds to match them up. It’s far more prone to error this way, even on pristine audio.</p>
<p>Another reason I don’t recommend it is because extraneous noise and speech errors complicate things. The transcription needs to match <em>exactly</em> what the person says, so DARLA recommends you remove things like loud breaths and other voices. You also need to remove things like false starts or stutters. And since we’re used to tuning those things out, you’re likely going to miss some. To me, this takes a lot of work—perhaps as much as just doing a transcription—and is still prone to error. One single “um” that you forgot to transcribe might throw off the entire transcription. It also means you’re no longer working with the original audio, which makes reproducibility difficult.</p>

<p>The last option for DARLA is to just have it extract formant measurements, given an already force-aligned TextGrid. You might need to do this if you have MFA installed on your computer already and just need to run FAVE. Or perhaps you took the MFA output that DARLA provides and made some corrections and want to get an updated spreadsheet of formant measrurements based on those updates.</p>
<p>This option is the last on the page of “semi-automated” options and the interface looks basically the same as all the others we’ve discussed above. Once again, see Section&nbsp;5.1 for more detail on the filtering options. Once you hit submit, see Section&nbsp;5.2.</p>
<p>You should know that DARLA has a tool to help <a href="http://darla.dartmouth.edu/asreval">look at the quality of transcriptions</a>.

<h3 data-number="5.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-filtering"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> The filtering options</h3>
<p>In pretty much every uploading interface in DARLA, you’ll be presented with three filtering options: stop-words, unstressed vowels, and bandwidths:</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/darla/filtering.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Let’s go through each of these:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>stop-words</strong>: This refers to the most common words in English. There are numerous lists of stopwords, so there’s no hard-and-fast rule for what is considered a stopword and what is not. <a href="http://darla.dartmouth.edu/stopwords">DARLA’s list</a> is relatively small. The reason why you’d want to remove stopwords is because they tend to be phonetically reduced. Because they’re so common, we tend not to say them with full vowel qualities as we might with other words. Some researchers are not interested in that kind of phonetic reduction, so they often remove stopwords from analysis because it arguably gets in the way of the patterns they hope to find.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>unstressed vowels</strong>: In English, unstressed vowels tend to be schwa-like or otherwise reduced. Many sociophoneticians are not interested in unstressed vowels and instead focus on the vowel quality of stressed vowels. So, you can filter those unstressed vowels out so you don’t have to worry about them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>bandwidths</strong>: This is a way to kinda measure the quality of audio at the moment the vowel formant measurements are taken. Without getting into the nitty-gritty of it, a larger bandwidth just means that the sound quality is probably not great, which means the formant estimation will be less reliable. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh7GPtzx5D8">Marinaccino, Shapp, &amp; Singler (2021)</a> is the only study I’ve seen that analyzes bandwidths directly, and they find that checking this box gives you a little less data but overall doesn’t affect the results all that much. Of course, it depends highly on the audio quality: this will filter out many more vowels from digitized cassette tapes than from audio recorded in a sound booth.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For what it’s worth, these filtering options are not an original feature of DARLA, but I’m glad they’re there.<sup>6</sup> I personally say “no” to all of those boxes so that I can be in control of the filters. For example, I use a different set of stopwords than what DARLA uses.<sup>7</sup> Ultimately, whether you use those filters is up to you.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn6"><p><sup>6</sup>&nbsp;I’m pretty sure they were added was because my team at the University of Georgia requested the option to opt out of those filters so that we could have greater flexibility in how we filter our data.</p></div><div id="fn7"><p><sup>7</sup>&nbsp;I typically use the one called “marimo” from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stopwords/readme/README.html">the stopwords R package</a>.</p></div></div><div class="callout callout-style-default callout-tip callout-titled" title="My Recommendation">

<h3 data-number="5.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-speaker_information"><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Enter Speaker Information</h3>
<p>Once you’ve filled out all the information on the form and hit the “submit” button, you’ll have to wait a minute or longer for your files to upload. If you’re working with large, uncompressed .wav files, it might take several minutes, depending on your internet connection. If you’re working with shorter .mp3 files, it might be only a few seconds. Don’t close the webpage just yet! You’ll need to wait until it’s fully uploaded, and only then will a couple new menu options appear that will prompt you to give the Speaker ID and their “Voice Type.”</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/darla/enter_speaker_information.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The Speaker ID is just whatever ID you use to refer to that speaker in your own records. If you’re doing just a one-off analysis of your speech or something, just put your name. If it’s part of a larger project, you can use the unique identifier (UT001-Joey or whatever).</p>
<p>For the Voice Type, this determines a setting in FAVE’s formant extraction. Typically, you’d use the “Low” option for men or taller people, and the “High” option for women and shorter people. But it’s not a precise setting, so if your data comes out looking messier than you expect, try resubmitting it with the other option and see if it works better.</p>
<p>Once you’ve hit “submit” this second time, you’re good to go. You are now free to close that window and you should get an email confirmation saying the process has started. See Section&nbsp;6 for more detail on what you do once DARLA has started processing your files.</p>

Tips for submitting multiple files in a row
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>If you plan on submitting multiple files to DARLA simultaneously in multiple tabs, it’s important to note that when you see this “Enter speaker information” part of the screen, the rest of the form resets. So, you won’t see the name of the audio or TextGrid you submitted. This is normally not a problem for the one-off file, but if you’ve got, say, five open DARLA tabs, you might forget which one had which files uploading. There were many times in grad school where I forgot which file was uploaded in that tab, and I ended up writing down the wrong speaker ID and selecting the wrong voice type, which means I had to process it all over again.</p>
<p>My first recommendation is to limit the number of simultaneous uploads to about five otherwise it might cause DARLA to crash for all of them. See Section&nbsp;7.2.2.</p>
<p>My other recommendation is to simply have a piece of paper handy and write down the names of the files you’re processing. Once you’ve submitted the speaker ID and voice type, you can cross off that speaker, close that tab (which moves all other tabs to the left), start a new DARLA tab all the way to the right, and write down that speaker. You then wait for the next one to finish uploading (they may not be ready in the order you submit them because of file size differences) and repeat the process, always carefully noting the order you submit them and crossing things off when you’re done. The highest uncrossed-out name on the paper corresponds to the leftmost DARLA tab. This technique has the added benefit of making it clear what files still need to be processed, reducing the accidental submission of the same file twice.<sup>8</sup></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn8"><p><sup>8</sup>&nbsp;I often had to process dozens of files in a single setting, and this technique worked for me. If you ever walked past my desk in grad school, you probably saw tons of little sheets of paper with speaker IDs organized in neat columns with all but the bottom five or so crossed out.</p></div></div></section>

<h2 data-number="6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-output"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> DARLA’s output</h2>
<p>If everything goes well, you should get two emails from DARLA. The first comes a few moments after you’ve submitted your files. It is just a confirmation to let you know that the processing has started. The second comes a few minutes later (perhaps up to 20 minutes) and contains five files for you. Let’s look at those individually.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>formants.csv</strong>: this is the whole reason you used DARLA. It contains all the formant measurements for the entire file. Unfortunately, it’s out of the scope of this tutorial to go through that file in depth, but I hope to have a separate tutorial on that soon.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>formants.fornorm.tsv</strong>: this is the same data as in formants.csv, but it’s formatted in a specific way so that it can be read in by an online tool called <a href="http://lingtools.uoregon.edu/norm/">NORM</a>. That site is used for normalizing vowel formant data. If you’re not sure what that means or how to use NORM that’s okay—it’s a bit of an outdated tool nowadays anyway. I usually do nothing with that file.</p></li>
<li><p>some sort of <strong>.TextGrid</strong> file: this is the word- and phoneme-level transcription provided by MFA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>transcription.txt</strong>: This contains just the text of the transcription file. This is useful in case you want to create a text corpus of your audio files. This file can easily be read into a program like <a href="https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/">AntConc</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>plot.pdf</strong>: A basic vowel plot of your data. I have some issues with this plot because it’s often a bit misleading. All vowels are averaged across the entire dataset to get these points, but the problem is it includes things like prerhotic and prenasal allophones which can throw everything off. If you don’t have any other data processing skills, this plot is the best you’ve got. (Stay tuned for an online tool I’ve created to help with creating interactive vowel plots based on DARLA data for people who don’t have coding skills!)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve got those files, you’re good! Save them in a place that makes sense, probably in the same folder with the audio and original transcription or maybe in a separate subfolder called “DARLA.”</p>

<h3 data-number="7.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-preparing_textgrids"><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Preparing TextGrids</h3>
<p>Here are a few tips you should keep in mind when preparing your TextGrids to reduce the likelihood of DARLA crashing or otherwise being unable to process your file.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make sure the tier you want to be transcribed by DARLA is called “sentence”.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t use digits in the transcription. So, type “nine” instead of “9”. This applies to dates and years too. For years, this is actually important because DARLA (well, technically MFA) won’t know whether “2017” is “twenty-seventeen” or “two thousand seventeen.” It might be unnatural to type those out, but it makes for a more accurate transcription and it’ll prevent some errors when processing it with DARLA.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t use curly quotes and apostrophes. To understand what I mean by that, I’ll need to get into some typographical detail, but it’s important. Every time you type the apostrophe or double-quote character, there’s a possibility that it’ll convert into a curly quote character. Here is a straight apostrophe ( <code>'</code> ) and double quote ( <code>"</code> ) and here are curly apostrophes ( ‘ ) or ( ’ ) and curly double quotes ( “ ) and ( ” )<sup>9</sup>. Not all software does this conversion automatically—Praat and ELAN do not—but if you’re copying text over from Microsoft Word or some other program, it’s likely that there are curly quotes in there. You should care about this because <em>DARLA will crash if it encounters a curly quote character</em>! So you’ll need to learn to spot them and change them back to straight quotes before uploading it to DARLA.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid very short intervals.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid including sharp intakes of breath in a transcribed interval. DARLA may think it’s an [h] sound which could mess up the rest of that interval. So, even if it’s mid-sentence, end an interval before the breath and start a new one after it. (In general, the way to exclude something from being analyzed in DARLA is to simply put it in an empty interval.)</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn9"><p><sup>9</sup>&nbsp;For more information about quotes, see <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/straight-and-curly-quotes.html">Butterick’s Practical Typography</a>.</p></div></div><p>Here is an example of what a TextGrid prepared for DARLA looks like:</p>
<div class="column-screen">
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/darla/textgrid_example.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div>
<p>Here, you can see I have just one tier and it’s called “sentence”. You can add more tiers if you want (and you probably should if you want to transcribe additional people, make a note of extraneous noise, or have other annotations), but DARLA will ignore it. Notice that the number is spelled out. And notice at the very end a loud sound (it was the interviewer saying something like “mm” as some verbal feedback). To have DARLA ignore it, I just left that interval blank.</p>

<h3 data-number="7.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-to-do-if-darla-crashes"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> What to do if DARLA crashes</h3>
<p>If you use DARLA, you will likely experience it crashing. It is, unfortunately, not an uncommon occurrence. In this section I go through some of the error messages you might see and how to maybe fix things so they’ll work with DARLA.</p>
<section id="a-terrifying-error-page" class="level4 page-columns page-full" data-number="7.2.1">
<h4 data-number="7.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-terrifying-error-page"><span class="header-section-number">7.2.1</span> A terrifying error page</h4>
<p>DARLA can crash in a variety of ways. Sometimes it’s a full-screen error page that is terrifying to some people.</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/darla/error_page.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In my experience, the most common reason this page shows up is because there’s some sort of special character in the transcription. This may be a curly quote, punctuation mark, or anything that is not normally used in English orthography. To force this page, I actually added an <em>é</em> to an otherwise good transcription.</p>
<p>Fortunately, while this page is scary, DARLA now sends you an email with specifics on where the problem occurred.<sup>10</sup> Here’s what my email looked like:</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn10"><p><sup>10</sup>&nbsp;I only discovered this today when I purposely triggered that error page! It must be a relatively new feature!</p></div></div><p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/darla/nonascii-email.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Here it gives very specific information about where the error occurred (between 10.7 seconds and 15.84 seconds into the transcription). It then gives the transcription of that interval, with the problematic character replced with “X”. The character’s unicode value is provided (“0xe9”), which you can google to hopefully get an answer about what it is. That information is exactly right: here’s the relevant section of the TextGrid:</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/darla/nonascii_textgrid.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>As you can see, there’s an <em>é</em> exactly where DARLA said it was! So, if you get an email like this, you can hopefully use it to find where the problem occurred and fix the special character.</p>

<h4 data-number="7.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-error_email"><span class="header-section-number">7.2.2</span> A generic error email</h4>
<p>Other times you’ll simply get an email saying DARLA failed:</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/darla/error_email.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This is, rather unfortunately, not a particularly helpful error message because it doesn’t say at all what the problem might be.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to just try submitting it again, possibly a third time. I have noticed that DARLA crashes if there are too many files in line to be processed at once.<sup>11</sup> So if you submit many files all in a row, try spacing them out.<sup>12</sup> If you happen to submit around the time other people are doing so, wait a few minutes or maybe try again later.</p>

  <title>A new publication in Linguistics Vanguard!</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Together with my co-authors, Lisa Morgan Johnson and Earl Kjar Brown, I’m happy to announce <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/lingvan-2024-0152/html">a new publication in <em>Linguistics Vanguard</em></a>!</p>
<section id="a-brief-summary" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-brief-summary">A “Brief” Summary</h2>
<p>The problem that sociophoneticians face when working with interview data—particularly recordings not originally intended for linguistic analysis like older oral narratives—is overlapping speech. When two people talk at the same time, it is usually impossible to get reliable formant measurements automatically. My impression is that that data is somehow tagged or detected as overlapping speech and is excluded. When you’re working with shorter recordings that don’t have a lot of data to begin with, it would be nice to recover that data.</p>
<p>So, we introduce source separation. It’s an algorithm that takes in a single audio file containing speech from multiple speakers, and split it up into different audio files, one for each speaker. It detects when each speaker is talking (aka <em>diarization</em>) and then uses fancy models to separate the speakers from each other. In theory, this is a great way to recover data that would have otherwise been excluded.</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper then is to see whether such source separation models can feasibly be incorporated into a sociophonetic pipeline. In other words, is the output of a source separation model reliable enough that we can trust the formant measurements that come from the separated audio?</p>
<p>We decided to stress test the method. We took some audio I collected in grad school of two speakers, a man and a woman from Georgia. On separate occasions, they both read 300 sentences in a sound booth. We then overlayed that audio to create a very cacophonous audio file of the two of them talking at the same time for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>We then used three source separation models to separate the two speakers: Libri2, Whamr, and WSJ02. This created six new audio files, one for each speaker and for each model. Combine those with the two original audio files, and we had eight.</p>
<p>For each of the eight files, we sent them through a typical sociophonetic pipeline. First, the originals were manually transcribed at the utterance-level and we used those transcriptions for the their respective derived source-separated audio. We then sent the audio and transcriptions through DARLA to have them force-aligned with MFA and formant-extracted with FAVE. We then followed the same order of operations to process them. In the end, we had four versions of spreadsheets of formant measurements for each speaker’s audio recording. We could then compare them to each other.</p>
<p>First, while coming through the audio, we noticed that two of the models did a pretty good job. But one, the WSJ02 didn’t. We don’t really recommend that one.</p>
<p>Looking through the vowel plots, we’re surprised at how good they were, especially compared to the original. In these vowel plots (the female is on the left and the male is on the right), all four panels look pretty similar for the most part, and they all look like the top left panel which has the original audio.</p>
<div class="quarto-layout-panel" data-layout-ncol="2">
<div class="quarto-layout-row">
<div class="quarto-layout-cell" style="flex-basis: 50.0%;justify-content: center;">
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/source_separation/female.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div>
<div class="quarto-layout-cell" style="flex-basis: 50.0%;justify-content: center;">
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/source_separation/male.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>However, when we ran statistical tests on the formant data and compared them to the original, there were some statistically significant differences. But thy varied depending on the vowel, the model, and the speaker. In this plot, red dots are statistically significant differences. But there are many gray dots, meaning the difference between the source-separated audio and the original was not significant much of the time.</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/source_separation/pairwise_comparisons.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Then when we zero in on specific comparison and then draw lines connecting points that came from the same observation in the two recordings, we see a fair number of differences. So, while the means may be comparable, the values from any one observation may not be close to the original. Thi sis a similar finding to what Strelluf &amp; Gordon report in <a href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781498597265/The-Origins-of-Missouri-English-A-Historical-Sociophonetic-Analysis">their book on historical sociophonetics</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/source_separation/boxplot_comparisons.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>So, we are cautiously optimistic about this. If you only model vowel means, you can probably feel comfortable doing so on source-separated data. But if you want to look at individual tokens, maybe not. Fortunately, most audio will not be as overlapped as this, so the effect will be smaller. Although, for dyads of speakers with similar sounding voices, it might not be as good.</p>
<p>We end with some recommendations, which I repeat here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Experiment with different models to find the one that is most suitable. In this rapidly developing field, models improve over time and new options emerge. So, rather than clinging to one that works, continuously explore potentially better tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Split audio at natural breaks rather than equal intervals. This can be done manually or using a script.</p></li>
<li><p>Listen to the output to ensure clean separation.</p></li>
<li><p>Transcribe based on the source-separated audio or ensure that existing transcriptions still match the new audio before conducting acoustic analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Treat formant estimates at the token level with caution. To be safe, only do analyses on vowel summaries like averages.</p></li>
<li><p>Carefully document and report all methodological choices and human interventions.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="backstory" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
<p>I enjoy learning about papers’ back stories, so here is ours.</p>
<p>May 7, 2024, Lisa and I were talking about this and pitched the idea to Earl. Earl is the one who knows how to implement this stuff, so he worked on it that month and on May 21st, he basically did a proof of concept and said “I think we may have a paper!” In June, we fine-tuned the methods and prepared the audio. We had big plans to do a more robust study with different gender dyads and audio qualities, but we figured for this proof of concept paper, we’d keep it simple. (We may submit a bigger version to <em>JASA</em> still.) By the end of June, we basically had the results we needed, so we submitted an abstract to LSA.</p>
<p>Soon after the abstract was submitted, I figured we might as well write-up the paper. On July 17, I said let’s try and submit to <em>Linguistics Vanguard</em>. For the next week or so, we had a really nice asynchronous collaboration going as we each chipped away at the various parts of the paper we contributed to. (I did the vowel analysis, Lisa did the qualitative analysis, and Earl actual Python scripting). On July 26th, we submitted it!</p>
<p>On October 9th, we got a provisional accept and some useful reviewer comments. Bad timing for us because Lisa and I were about to head to NWAV. But on November 19, we returned the manuscript at 11:54am and at 7:01pm it was officially accepted! Quickest turn-around time ever! We submitted the final version on November 20th, got proofs on January 5th, we presented it at LSA on January 12th, and it was published online on January 29th.</p>
<p>So from inception (May 7) to paper submission (June 26) was 11 weeks. And from original submission to publication (January 29) was 26 weeks. Not too shabby.</p>

<p>This week I’m in Philadelphia at annual meetings of the Linguistic Society of America and the American Dialect Society. I gave three talks, which you can download here, I officially started two new service positions, and I got an award! It was a busy conference for me!</p>

<p>On Saturday morning at the ADS session, Peggy Renwick presented research on behalf of our research term on prelateral front vowels and how they’ve changed over time in Georgia. The talk is called “Complementary pre-lateral mergers across ethnicities and generations in Georgia.” Overall, we find that the various prelateral mergers peaked and reversed at different times for Black and White speakers, and for the two <em>feel-fill</em> and <em>fail-fell</em> pairs.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoon, I presented with my student, Hallie Davidson, a poster called “Variation in Early 20th Century Utah English.” This is the first time I’ve presented results from a collection of oral narratives I acquired called the “Kohler Tapes.” I’ve written blog posts about <a href="../../blog/kohler-tapes">how I acquired the tapes</a>, <a href="../../blog/kohler-tapes-update">the process of digitizing them</a>, and <a href="../../blog/kohler-tapes-update2">a summary of the metadata</a>, so I won’t repeat that here. But, because Hallie has been working on transcribing these tapes, we finally have some really preliminary linguistic results to present. They’re just impressionistic right now, nothing really conclusive, but we show that there’s a lot of variation in this collection. We’re excitedly working on some developments that involve training an AI model on this data so we can get the rest transcribed and we look forward to doing acoustic analysis soon!</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, my final presentation was with Lisa Morgan Johnson (who presented with me) and Earl Kjar Brown. We were interested in source separation, which is where you separate overlapping audio into different tracks, one per speaker. We wanted to see if current algorithms produced reliable enough data for sociophonetic analysis. We took two recordings and processed them using typical methods and called that output the ground truth. We than synthetically overlapped the audio to create a cacophonous overlapping recording. We then tried three source separate models and processed the resulting audio files and compared them to the baseline.</p>
<p>We’re cautiously optemisitic about the results. There were some differences here and there, but on the whole the output formant measurements were pretty similar. However, we did notice that while the <em>mean</em> formants per vowel per speaker were similar, at the indidual token level, there were larger differences.</p>
<p>Anyway, we hope this will spark some interest in source separation and maybe help people recover audio that was previously unanalyzable!</p>

  <title>Synthesis Days</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>
  <link>https://joeystanley.com/blog/synthesis_days/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I don’t often post just about teaching, but I thought I’d report on something I tried this past semester. I had some issues with how I taught sociolinguistics in the past, so I came up with “synthesis days” to solve some of them. I think it worked and it might be useful for you too.</p>
<section id="issues-with-past-iterations-of-the-course" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="issues-with-past-iterations-of-the-course">Issues with past iterations of the course</h2>
<p>While prepping to teach sociolinguistics again, I thought back on things I didn’t like about how I’ve taught it in the past. For one, it was one of my first courses I taught, so the slides were a bit amateurish and they needed to be spruced up a little bit. (I guess that says something about how I’ve grown as a teacher or whatever.)</p>
<p>But one main issue was that my version of the course was a holdover from covid-era teaching. The first time I taught it, it was a single 75-minute lecture taught twice a week. One section came in on Tuesday and the other came in Thursday. On students’ off-days, they did some online content I prepared for them. It worked for that early 2021 semester. I later taught it as a stand-alone graduate level course (as opposed to a cross-listed one) where I split that 75-minute lecture into two 50-minute lectures and then we discussed articles on Fridays. But now that I was teaching it as a regular Monday-Wednesday-Friday 50-minute course, I needed to make some changes beyond just continuing the stretch out what was once just a single lecture.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I had some issues with how assessment happened. I had weekly open-book quizzes, weekly mini-projects for homework assignments, a midterm and final, and a final project. It was a lot, and I just didn’t feel like those quizzes and tests were good assessment tools.</p>
<p>Finally, one big issue I had was that the course was too modular. The topics didn’t build upon each other as much as I’d like and each week was more or less independent of the other. This means that a student could miss two weeks of class and then jump right in without feeling behind, and I don’t think that should be the case.</p>
<p>So, I went for a long walk and had a conversation with ChatGPT to help brainstorm some ideas. While many of its ideas were no good, it did spark an idea of my own. I decided to try adding “Synthesis Days” to the course.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-synthesis-days" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-synthesis-days">The synthesis days</h2>
<p>The course was already broken up into four broad units: situated language, language variation, language attitudes, and the life cycle of language. You can see the syllabus <a href="../../downloads/250103-L452_syllabus.pdf">here</a>. So, at the end of each unit, I dedicated an entire lecture to synthesizing what we had just discussed for the past 2–3 weeks. Theses synthesis days consisted of three main components: a paper, a presentation, and a discussion.</p>
<section id="the-synthesis-paper" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-synthesis-paper">The synthesis paper</h3>
<p>Each student had to write a synthesis paper for the unit. I emphasized that this was a <em>synthesis</em>, not a summary, so if they just wrote a paper that regurgitates the various topics from that unit one paragraph at a time, they would not get a good grade. You can read the prompt <a href="../../downloads/250103_L452_synthesis_prompt.pdf">here</a>, but I emphasized that I wanted them to draw connections between topics in the unit and to see how they relate to each other. I encouraged them to incorporate examples from class as well as add their own. They needed to cover every lecture topic from that unit without dwelling too much on any one too much, which means if they were gone at any point during the unit, they’d have to play catch-up. I didn’t give them a page/word limit, but I said I’d be hard to do a good job in less than 500 words. I graded them holistically out of ten.</p>
<p>Unlike other assignments, these synthesis papers were due when class started on the synthesis days. I wanted to see how students did without getting ideas from others in the presentation or discussion.</p>
<p>I will say that students expressed how difficult it was to do these papers. Sure enough, the first unit’s synthesis papers averaged an 8.3. They often lost points for not incorporating all the topics, not having a clear narrative throughout, being too much of a summary, and not discussing the bigger picture. But, I gave detailed feedback, and the average scores went up to 9.1, then a 9.7, and then a 10.0 (yes, they all did excellent the last time!). So, it was really cool to see them grow and finally learn how to write these. However, they took a long time to grade, and these were on top of regular weekly assignments, so that was tricky for me to stay caught up.</p>
<p>I think being able to do a synthesis like this is a good skill for other areas of writing. In fact, when I graded their final papers, I found myself giving the same kind of feedback in their literature reviews as I did on the synthesis papers (“don’t dwell on one paper too much”, “I don’t see a narrative”, “avoid the one-citation-per-paragraph summary”, “discuss the bigger picture”). Next time I teach the course, I’ll have to explicitly make the connection for them that the skills acquired in these syntheses should be applied to literature reviews.</p>
<p>Overall, I liked the synthesis papers and I plan on doing them again next year. I’ll just need to make sure I can grade them on time!</p>
</section>
<section id="the-synthesis-presentation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-synthesis-presentation">The synthesis presentation</h3>
<p>So what do we do on the synthesis day? Instead of me giving a lecture, I thought it’d be good to see students present. So, this year I had 20 students and four units, so I randomly assigned them into groups of five and randomly assigned each group to each unit. Groups were then asked each one to prepare a 20-minute synthesis lecture for their assigned unit. So on each synthesis day, we saw one group presentation. Those who presented for that unit were exempt from turning in a paper. The presentations should have been similar in style to the papers: a synthesis rather than a summary, covering all topics equally, and incorporating new and old examples.</p>
<p>The presentations were mostly okay, but I realized this is a difficult thing to do well as a group. What I mostly saw was five students each giving good stand-alone presentations back-to-back. They were less unified in their delivery than I was hoping and there was usually not much of a larger narrative or arc that permeated through the entire thing.</p>
<p>This was my first time ever doing group work and I’m not sure if I’ll keep it for next time. They were hard for the students, difficult to grade, and I’m not sure what pedagogical purpose they served.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-synthesis-discussion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-synthesis-discussion">The synthesis discussion</h3>
<p>For the remainder of the 50-minute lecture, we broke out into small groups and discussed the unit. I asked presenters to end their lecture with a handful of questions to stimulate some discussion topics. I then distributed the five presenters among the rest of the class so they could kind of lead the discussions. I jumped from group to group, contributing ideas here and there and just listening to what they were saying.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised at how well these discussions went. Pretty much everyone stayed on-track as far as I could tell. People had good ideas and it was good to see them come out in those discussions. Everyone had the synthesis fresh on their minds because they all either gave a presentation or turned in a paper, so everyone was prepared. But it was good to see people telling personal stories and how the topics from the unit give them a different perspective on what happened. I heard a few students say they enjoyed this as an end-cap to the unit as well.</p>
<p>I’ll definitely try to do discussions again next year. My one issue is that because they were not graded, I noticed attendance was lower on the synthesis days. I’ll have to find a way to encourage students to be there.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I liked these synthesis days and will probably do them again next time I teach the course. I’ll have to tweak a few things, but overall I thought it was really good.</p>
<p>I will say that one major thing about adding four synthesis lectures is that I had to account for four non-contentful lecture days. I also took the last two weeks of the course (so, the five days after Thanksgiving) and made those final presentation days. So in total, there were nine non-lecture days. Keep in mind that my first iteration of the course had just fifteen 75-minute lectures, so it’s not like there were nine lectures that were just cut out entirely. But it did mean I had to be careful about covering everything I wanted in only about 35 lecture days. But, I thought keeping the units tight and more integrated was good for me as a teacher and for the students.</p>
<p>So, overall, I think these synthesis days solved many of my issues: the course was far less modular, there were more useful assessments than quizzes and exams, and the lectures were better organized and updated with fresh content.</p>

<p>This is edited from an email that I sent out this morning to the students in my undergraduate sociolinguistics course that just finished teaching. There is so much more I could say but I wanted to keep it focused on what they might know. I hope there aren’t any inaccuracies in what I’ve written. I only knew Bill Labov from a distance but he was still an influential figure for me.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>It is with a heavy heart that I inform you that Bill Labov—the linguist behind the fourth floor study and Martha’s Vineyard Island study and the founder of variationist sociolinguistics—passed away yesterday at the ripe age of 97 at his home with his wife by his side.</p>
<p>Looking through this semester, I mentioned Labov at least nine times. He introduced attention to speech, the observer’s paradox, and the vernacular principle to linguistics and created the sociolinguistic interview. With his dissertation in New York, he introduced the idea of systematic variation or, as he puts it, ordered heterogeneity. He was the one to point out the gender paradox. He popularized Herzog’s and Garde’s principles in the study of language change (and coined those terms). He supervised the creation of the Penn Neighborhood Corpus and supervised students’ sociolinguistic interviews around Philadelphia for decades. That corpus now serves as an invaluable resource for tracking phonetic change over time. Looking back, I’m surprised that’s all I’ve said about him, because there are so many other important ideas he’s introduced to the field.</p>
<p>He was a prolific writer and extremely involved in the field. He founded <em>Language in Society</em> in 1972, which has since become a premiere venue for sociolinguistics research. He also founded another extremely influential journal, <em>Language Variation and Change</em> and edited it for a long time. He was a former president of the Linguistic Society of America and the American Dialect Society. He has numerous books, many of which are foundational in sociolinguistics. His last one, <em>Conversations with Strangers</em>, which he wrote with his wife, was published just last year and contains stories about the awesome things he’s learned from people in the 1000+ sociolinguistic interviews he conducted. (If you’ve ever done a sociolinguistic interview, you’ll find that <em>everyone</em> has a cool story.) I happened to buy that book recently, so that’ll be what I read this evening.</p>
<p>He mentored <a href="https://academictree.org/linguistics/tree.php?pid=24968&amp;fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR0k0VUZutEQngweBenpabuZMw8o4-hQ_XY4Auu60uAV9q8clumQyUNAsfI_aem_a9n9R6rxPmVLJOnGmS7X2A">countless</a> students at the University of Pennsylvania, many of whom have gone on to be their own giants in sociolinguistics. Among those whose ideas I’ve brought into class include Penny Eckert (she did the Jocks vs.&nbsp;Burnouts study and is the founder of 3rd Wave Sociolinguistics and brought ideas like indexicality to sociolinguistics), John Rickford (leading figure on African American English and proponent of the Creole Origins Hypothesis of African American English), John Baugh (housing discrimination), Anne Charity-Hudley (educational linguistics and linguistic activism). Many of them have then gone to mentor other giants in sociolinguistics. I can trace my academic lineage to Labov through Penny Eckert and can call him my academic great-great-grandfather.</p>
<p>While entire <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/labov-a-guide-for-the-perplexed-9781441158529/">books</a> and <a href="https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/document/obo-9780199772810/obo-9780199772810-0195.xml">annotated bibliographies</a> have been written about his scholarly work, perhaps his bigger contribution to the world is in social activism and the pursuit of linguistic justice. He not only coined the “Principle of Error Correction” and the “Principle of Debt Incurred” as nice ideas, but he lived them too: he was an early researcher of African American English and, 30 years later, testified at a senate hearing on the legitimacy of African American English in the wake of the Oakland Ebonics Controversy. He was a champion for the underdog, marginalized communities, and children and did countless acts of uncompensated work in the community, far beyond what is expected from a professor.</p>
<p>All who knew him personally describe him so positively. He regularly cites older scholars, lesser-known researchers, and students in his own and he acknowledges that many of the ideas we attribute to him actually came from someone else. He was humble in his contributions and was so happy to hear of someone proving him wrong. He was his students’ loudest cheerleader and saw the potential in them before they did themselves. He attended their extra-curricular activities and weddings, and met their friends and families. He is the kind of mentor I try to be like. <a href="https://jofrhwld.github.io/blog/posts/2024/12/2024-12-17_in-remembrance/">Here</a> is a very nice tribute by Joe Fruehwald that I think captures the kinds of things I’ve heard from his students. <a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=67399">This post in Language Log</a> also shares these sentiments. If you look up other linguists on social media right now, you’ll see numerous other similar tributes. As for me, he attended my very first conference presentation in 2015 where I talked about address forms among Latter-day Saints (which shows that even he was willing to listen to students’ work) and while I did have the opportunity to see him speak at various conferences, unfortunately, I never had a chance to meet him. So all I know about him I learned from a distance and through others’ accounts; I can’t even imagine how awesome it would have been like to take classes from him.</p>
<p>Bill Labov is the reason I became a sociolinguist. I remember learning about the fourth floor study in my intro to linguistics course and thought it was one of the most fascinating studies ever. Since then, I have read so much of his work and it has been the foundation of my own research. The first time I went to New York City, I didn’t care to see the Statue of Liberty, One World Trade Center, Rockefeller Plaza, or Central Park. No, I did a pilgrimage to Saks, Macy’s, and the building where S. Klein was located and got workers to say “fourth floor” there. I encourage you to read Labov’s own account of <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~wlabov/HowIgot.html">how he got into linguistics</a>. Interestingly, he was a chemist for over a decade before beginning linguistics in his 30s, which just goes to show the value that late bloomers, non-traditional students, and people with unique backgrounds have on academia. He was a giant of a person and the best linguist of our generation.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ll look forward to grading your final papers today. Thanks for a great semester.</p>
<p>Joey</p>

  <title>A new volume in the Publications of the American Dialect Society series!</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I am thrilled to announce the publication of the 109th volume of the Publications of the American Dialect Society (PADS) series. This one is called “Movement, Economy, Orientation: Twentieth-Century Shifts in North American Language” and was edited by me, Peggy Renwick, and Monica Nesbitt. In it, you’ll find our introduction and then eight fantastic chapters by phenomenal contributors. I am so fortunate to have worked with such amazing collaborators.</p>

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The premise of the volume came from something I read Monica write in her 2021 paper in <em>American Speech</em>. She wrote</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="margin-aside">Nesbitt, Monica. 2021. The Rise and Fall of the Northern Cities Shift.” <em>American Speech</em> 96(3). 332–70. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1215/00031283-8791754">https://doi.org/10.1215/00031283-8791754</a>.</span></div></div>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“[T]he Baby Boomer–Gen X transition appears to be a pivotal transition throughout the country… [and] appears to be of great importance to North American English dialects in general.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps one reason why this stood out to me (other than the fact that the Monica’s entire paper is just brilliant writing and I’m lucky have collaborated with her) is it very well describes what me and colleagues were finding in the South. Around this time, Peggy Renwick, Jon Forrest, and I were looking at our data from seven generations of Georgians, and—I believe it was Peggy who spotted it first—we noticed that the generation with the most canonical Southern Vowel Shift was the Baby Boomers. Monica continues:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“As future studies look to the Baby Boomer–Gen X transition as a pivotal moment of linguistic change, we must also consider other important social changes of the period, such as the increase in (geographic and economic) mobility, the rise of television and mediated speech, and so on. It is my contention that all of these aspects of lifestyle changes have contributed to the drastic changes to the North American regional map that appear to be unfolding.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this volume does then is it provides a coherent explanation for these simultaneous language changes being found in a lot of discontinuous places. In our introduction, we discuss population shifts and economic changes through out the 20th Century with a focus on that Boomer–Gen X transition around the 1950s and 1960s. We also discuss how people’s orientations towards or away from places gets mixed into all of this. We briefly summarize generational theory and highlight many sociolinguistics studies that have found that language variation can be in part predicted by generational cohort. The eight chapters that make up the bulk of the book each contain case studies that show evidence for these changes across different speech communities and linguistic phenomena. Some provide evidence for the Boomer–Gen X transition. Others provide evidence that more local changes were stronger influences on language. Overall, the volume is a cohesive set of studies that illustrate the kinds of linguistic changes that have happened in the mid-to-late 20th Century in North American English and the kinds of social forces that likely influenced those changes. Here’s a list of the chapters in the volume ▼</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/PADS109/contents.jpeg" class="img-fluid" width="360"></p>
<p>I think it’s really useful to have a volume specifically dedicated to an observation that’s being made in lots of independent speech communities. Since we are not sociologists, demographers, economists, or historians, each linguist who writes about these mid-century changes can only speculate about what kinds of social forces were at play. But having it all combined into one volume I think makes it easier to connect the dots and make connections between what would otherwise have been isolated studies. I hope the volume is useful for you. Each chapter provides a rich case study of changes in a particular speech community and can stand on its own as an in-depth documentation of language changes in the 20th Century. But when combined, particularly with the overview that the editors have written in the introduction, I think you’ll get a greater sense of the larger pattern being described.</p>
<section id="notes-about-the-introduction" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="notes-about-the-introduction">Notes about the Introduction</h2>
<p>Writing the Introduction was one of the academically challenging things I’ve been involved in. Part of the reason was because it’s the first time I’ve written something that wasn’t a “study” in the sense of providing novel results from some dataset, but rather an overview and synthesis of a larger topic. This involved looking outside of linguistics to find evidence for the arguments that we make. Another reason why it was so difficult for me personally is because it was entirely written while I was on parental leave. My time, access to a university library, and mental capacity to put towards this were all extremely limited. I’m so grateful for my co-authors generally, but also for their willingness to step up and cover for me while I was busy being unavailable and unhelpful. There’s no way the introduction or volume could have turned as as well as it did without them.</p>
<p>We knew that we had to cite a tremendous amount of research to make the case that the ideas we’re talking about are found over and over. In my own style of writing, I tend to be pretty citation-heavy anyway, but it looks like the references section for just the introduction ended up being nine pages long! But, while summarizing linguistics research is one thing, summarizing other research is so much tricker. Some parts of the introduction were divvied up, and one of my tasks was to write about how the economy shifted in the 20th Century and how that might have affected language. I’m not an economist or historian so this was new territory for me. (I had to relearn things I was taught in middle and high school social studies classes!) I thought that there’d be plentiful books on the history of 20th Century economics in the United States, but I had a hard time finding any. I had to explore a part of the library I didn’t know existed, and while I couldn’t find a summary with just the right amount of detail that I needed and could understand, I was also overwhelmed with the amount of related material. So summarizing a topic I knew little about and tying it into linguistics was tricky and I hope I did it justice.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>I also wrote most of the section on generational theory. I’ll be the first to admit—and I do so in the chapter—that generational theory verges on the territory of pseudoscience, especially if you look at the strong positions held by Strauss &amp; Howe (1991). However, recent researchers like Jean Twenge provide compelling data-driven evidence for the idea that generational cohorts are not a completely bogus idea. In the end, that section about generational theory—while <em>much</em> shorter than what I originally wrote—may be helpful for linguists who divide their participants into generational cohorts to track stepwise language change. Of course it’s best to model age as a non-linear continuous variable, if you have enough data to do (see Fruehwald 2021). But for most people, the next best thing is to group participants into discrete generational cohorts—either societal ones like Boomers, Gen Xers, Millennials, and Gen Zers, or more locally defined ones—and modeling those as an ordinal variable.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="margin-aside">Strauss, William, and Neil Howe.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Another section I wrote was towards the end about Standard Language Ideology. Katie Carmichael tipped me off about Bonfiglio (2002) during a Q&amp;A session at ADS in 2023. While the writing style is a bit different than what I’m used to, it is a fascinating read and has completely changed my views of what Standard American English really is. I don’t really offer any new insight beyond what Bonfiglio discusses, but I think its important to bring up the racist and xenophobic backstory of what Standard American English is a little more.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="margin-aside">Bonfiglio, Thomas Paul. <em>Race and the Rise of Standard American</em>.

<p>Finally, I forgot that the book immortalizes a cute thing my toddler does. I mentioned offhand that he says some words in an Australian accent because of the show <em>Bluey</em>. I thought it got cut, so I was delighted to see that little nugget make its way to the final edition.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="behind-the-scenes-look-at-the-volumes-development">Behind-the-scenes look at the volume’s development</h2>
<p>I think it’s fun to read about the background of papers and projects, so I thought I share some insight into how this book came to be.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>On January 3rd, 2022, I was in a meeting over Zoom with my Georgia English research team (Peggy Renwick, Jon Forrest, and Lelia Glass), presumably preparing for our ADS presentation a week later. Among the Georgians we studied, we noticed a major change in the speech of Baby Boomers compared to Gen Xers. We’ve noticed this in multiple speech communities now and Jon mentioned offhand that such a topic would make for a great PADS volume.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="margin-aside">You can read about those findings in <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/language-variation-and-change/article/boomer-peak-or-gen-x-cliff-from-svs-to-lbms-in-georgia-english/6AEA44E9263DFAE376F3BB20E087E5F9">our 2023 LVC paper</a>.</span></div></div>
<p>A week later at the ADS, I noticed this mentioned in multiple presentations. Aaron Dinkin said something like, “‘and then the pattern goes away after the boomers’ is a common observation”. So, I started to discuss the observation more broadly with a few people during and after the conference. I reached out to editors of others PADS volumes people about the feasibility of editing a volume pre-tenure, and it didn’t sound too bad. Valerie Fridland, for example, said it’s not a tremendous amount of work, but there are bursts of intense activity (soliciting contributors, reviewing) and then long periods of nothing. I also wrote to Natalie Schilling, the series editor, to soft-pitch the idea of this being a PADS volume. After lots of emails back and forth and the encouragement of many people, I decided I’d spearhead the project by around January 9th, 2022.</p>
<p>By mid-February 2022, Peggy and Monica were on board to be co-editors of the volume. Peggy is a longtime collaborator of mine and Monica’s 2021 paper is what spurred the idea in the first place. (After my pitch to Monica, her first question was, “How many volumes did you have in mind?” We could have included <em>many</em> more chapters but we just couldn’t!) We then put together a list of potential contributors and painfully whittled it down to those that had the greatest geographic, social, and linguistic coverage.</p>
<p>On May 5th, 2022, the three of us officially pitched the idea to Natalie. She gave a soft approval and then asked for a list of contributors. So, we started reaching out to people, inviting them to contribute. By the end of that month, we had a tentative list of authors, topics, a shared GoogleDrive folder, and a greenlight from PADS. We were ready to go!</p>
<p>For reference, and only because I know it has been adopted by at least one edited volume in progress, here is the timeline we set up. This was borrowed from Valerie Fridland, although with a little extra wiggle room in some places since we had well over two years from the start to the intended publication date.</p>
<ul>
<li>May 2022: Invite contributors.</li>
<li>September 1, 2022 (three months later): Submit an abstract.</li>
<li>May 15, 2023 (nine months later): Submit a manuscript draft.</li>
<li>July 15, 2023 (two months later): Editors return comments to authors. Editors write Introduction.</li>
<li>December 13, 2023 (five months later): Authors return revisions. Editors compile everything and submit to Series Editor for external review. (Note that this phase took about two months longer than we anticipated, mostly because the introduction was a beast to write and I was parental leave at the time.)</li>
<li>May 16, 2024 (five months later): External reviews received and sent to authors.</li>
<li>June 24, 2024 (six weeks later): Revisions returned to editors. Entire volume submitted to PADS.</li>
<li>September-ish, 2024 (three months later): Proofs received from Duke University Press. Author publication agreements signed. (Copyediting and some slight changes here and there happened in August.)</li>
<li>Mid-December 2024 (three months later): Volume is shipped and made available online.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, very broadly, we gave people about a year to write the chapters. It took a little over a year to do two rounds of revisions (an internal one by the editors and an external one facilitated by the Series Editor). About six months after submitting the whole thing, it was published. I felt like this was a comfortable timeline. It had its bouts of intense activity, but that’s to be expected, and overall, it wasn’t a crazy amount of work, partially because there were three co-editors. If I do an edited volume in the future, I’ll likely adopt a similar timeline.</p>

<p>My research team, including Jon Forrest, Peggy Renwick, and Lelia Glass, presented yet again at NWAV with our talk called “Natural Class Reorganization over Apparent Time by Prelateral /u/ and /oʊ/ in Georgia.” We focused on prelateral vowels and how they’ve changed over time. Focusing just on /ul/ and /ol/, what we’re calling <a href="../../blog/extending-wells-lexical-sets-to-prelateral-vowels"><sc>spool</sc> and <sc>jolt</sc></a>, we found that their relationship with their preobstruent counterparts has changed over time in Georgia English. Earlier generations had them slightly backer than their preobstruent counterparts, likely due to mere articulatory consequences. Evidence for this comes from the fact that <sc>spool</sc> is as front as <sc>boot</sc> in our oldest speakers. Later generations separate them quite a lot. For Black speakers it was seen in Gen Zers as they began fronting <sc>boot</sc>; for White speakers it was as the prelateral vowels backed even more. We therefore describe a reorganization of natural classes and the birth of a new natural class, prelaterals, in this speech community.</p>

<p>Hallie Davidson is working with me on our project called, “Social Meaning of Closure Duration in the Affrication of /ls/ and /lθ/ in Utah English.” In some previous work, I noticed that some people in Utah have closures in /lθ/ clusters as in <em>health</em>, <em>filth</em>, or <em>wealth</em> and that there might be some correlations between longer closures and membership in some social groups. Hallie is testing that specifically by setting up a matched-guise test and seeing if people respond differently to longer durations. This is a “Project Launch” poster, so we welcome any feedback on what questions to ask or how to ensure that our recordings are as natural as possible. We suspect that longer closures will index some social meaning among Utahns. If we do find that, this might be the first time that that particular acoustic cue—closure durations—have shown to be socially meaningful in a language that doesn’t have geminate stops!</p>

<p>We use the Corpus of North American Spoken English (CoNASE; Coats 2019, 2023), which has YouTube transcriptions of over 300,000 geotagged regional and local government videos from across the US and Canada. It represents over 150,000 hours of spoken language and 1.2 billion words of text. We follow Grieve’s (2016) methods and extract information from 135 grammatical alternation variables. We then ran spatial stats to identify areas where those alternations cluster together. Basically, we’re using YouTube to identify regional grammatical variation. Our presentation today could only show a few of the over 200 maps that we’ve generated and here’s just one of my favorites.</p>
<p><img src="https://joeystanley.com/blog/aacl2024/slide10.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We’re just getting started in our analysis of this unbelievably big and rich dataset. Stay tuned for many more additional findings in future presentations!</p>
