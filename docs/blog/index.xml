  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After exactly seven years with my old website, I’ve decided to change it to what you are seeing now.</p>
<section id="what-was-wrong-with-the-old-one" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-was-wrong-with-the-old-one">What was wrong with the old one?</h2>
<p>I built my old website in September 2016. I had a research assistantship at the DigiLab at UGA, and Emily McGinn, the supervisor, suggested I find ways to increase my online presence. I learned some <a href="../../blog/making-a-website-is-fun">web design and CSS skills</a> skills and eventually made Version 1 of my website. That version was essentially the same as what I built in the tutorial I followed, so a few months later I rewrote everything from scratch and made Version 2. (Let’s be honest though, it’s still obviously heavily based on the tutorial.) Other than very minor tweaks to a few things, that’s how my website has been since then.</p>
<p>However, it got a bit unwieldy. The blog was organized just fine, but I also added pages here and there to go along with workshops and other presentations I gave. It got more confusing when I gave the same workshop a second time and had multiple similar pages floating around. Since I didn’t foresee some of these additions, its growth was reminiscent of unplanned suburban sprawl. For examples, sometimes images were just dumped into a folder, others were better organized. Non-blog pages were hidden and were sometimes a top-level page and other times within a dedicated subdirectory. Each individual addition wasn’t a big deal, but once I stepped back and looked at it all, it was a mess.</p>
<p>The format of my tutorials wasn’t consistent either. I have lots of handouts on my website, tucked away here and there. If they were associated with a workshop, they were separate R Markdown files that didn’t fit in with the rest of the site. Some of my earliest ones are PDFs of Word files!If they weren’t associated with a workshop, they’re regular blog posts. But because the site wasn’t connected to R, I had to do a <em>lot</em> of copying and pasting R Markdown code and careful insertion of images to get those tutorials to look right. In some cases, the extra work made it possible to do things like syntax highlighting in Praat and highlighting specific lines of code. But that was all done by manually inserting HTML tags and updating my CSS.</p>
<p>Also, as careful as I was about my CSS, it wasn’t perfect. I think there were some issues if like a list had only one element, and there were things with hyperlinks. Some one-off portions of blogs or tutorials sometimes didn’t look right. I had a disclaimer at the top of every page, something like, “This website is built from scratch. Pardon the flaws; I am not a web designer.” Which was a humble brag if anything. But as the site grew I didn’t want to change the CSS because it might change some blog post from years ago in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I didn’t mind the mess because it’s what made my site unique. But, what made me finally decide to migrate to Quarto was the underlying architecture. It was built using Jekyll, which involves a programming language called Ruby in some way. After seven years I still have no idea what either of those are. I did this because it’s what the tutorial I followed used. When the site worked, it was great. But sometimes, the Ruby dependencies (called “gems”) would update or break or whatever and I had to google around trying to find a fix. I had no idea what I was doing and it led to a lot of frustrated late nights trying to get my website up and running again.</p>
<p>Then Quarto comes along, which makes it easy to make a blog entirely within R Studio. I have been very familiar with the R world for a while. In 2017, I was an early adopter of <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/">Shiny</a> (at least in linguistics, I think), so I was able to integrate all my html, CSS, and R skills into the <a href="http://lap3.libs.uga.edu/u/jstanley/vowelcharts/">Gazetteer of Southern Vowels</a>. In 2020, I also started dabbling with creating my own R Packages and using the amazing <a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org">pkgdown</a> to make dedicated websites for them (see <a href="https://joeystanley.github.io/joeyr/">joeyr</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JoeyStanley/futurevisions">futurevisions</a>, <a href="https://joeystanley.github.io/barktools/">barktools</a>, and <a href="https://joeystanley.github.io/joeysvowels/">joeysvowels</a>). Finally, I have a side project that involves collecting and analyzing data about what hymns are sung in LDS congregations, and in 2023 I decided to build the <a href="hymnstats.joeystanley.com">site</a> entirely in Quarto.</p>
<p>So, I’ve gradually built up to web development in R over the years and Quarto seems like the logical place to migrate to. Plus, it has some features that I’ve always wanted, like scrolling table of contents and a search feature. After some encouragement from folks on Twitter, I decided it’s time to bite the bullet and go for it.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-does-it-take-to-migrate" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-does-it-take-to-migrate">What does it take to migrate?</h2>
<p>I’m doing this page by page. Here’s the order I took:</p>
<ul>
<li>My homepage and any links on it. I didn’t clean up the linked pages, but at least there weren’t any dead links.</li>
<li>My blogs.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="things-that-are-the-same" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="things-that-are-the-same">Things that are the same</h2>
<p>I’ve tried to keep as much of the original structure of the site the same as I could. However, as I migrate</p>
</section>
<section id="changes" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="changes">Changes</h2>
<p>Here’s a list of the changes I’ve made.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each blog is now in its own self-contained folder. The previous structure had all posts in a single folder and all images in another folder. This time, the images associated with a blog post are contained within that folder. So, instead of this:</p>
<pre><code>├──📁blog
|  ├──📄blog post 1.md
|  ├──📄blog post 2.md
├──📁images
|  ├──🌅image1.png
|  ├──🌅image2.png</code></pre>
<p>It’s now this:</p>
<pre><code>├──📁blog
|  ├──📁blog post 1
|  |  ├──  📄index.qmd
|  |  ├──  🌅image1.png
|  ├──📁blog post 2
|  |  ├──  📄index.qmd
|  |  ├──  🌅image2.png</code></pre>
<p>It shouldn’t affect any urls to existing blog posts because the url <code>blog/blog post 1</code> in the old format would go to the <code>blog post 1.md</code> file and in the new one it’ll go to the <code>blog post 1</code> directory, which’ll display <code>index.qmd</code> by default. I was concerned about changing the url because I know some people have cited my turorials in published work and I didn’t want those urls to break. I think this’ll work <em>and</em> it’ll keep the site better organized.</p></li>
<li><p>Within each post, I need to update the header. I change from “tags” to “categories”, from “redirect_from” to “aliases.” I add a date-modified if needed. I remove excerpts because I only used them with my “big-link” style button. I’m replacing big-links with a standard callout box. I haven’t figured out if I can do redirects-to, which is a bummer for the GSV.</p></li>
</ul>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Today I gave a talk that Betsy Sneller and I have been working on called “How Sample Size Impacts Pillai Scores – and What Sociophoneticians Should Do About It” at the 50th New Ways of Analyzing Variation conference in San Jose! This is an updateto what we presented at <a href="../../blog/asa2021">ASA2021</a>.</p>
<p>We have three things you can download.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>First is <a href="../../downloads/221014-NWAV50_pillai.pptx">the actual powerpoint file</a>. In the notes of each slide though you can see the actual script I read, so you can read every word that was said during the talk.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, if that’s too much for you, you can download just <a href="../../downloads/221014-NWAV50_pillai.pdf">a PDF of the talk</a>. In case you want this ligherweight version of the slides.</p></li>
<li><p><del>Finally, here is the current manuscript that is under review with the <em>Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</em>. The final product will likely change somewhat, but most of the information is there.</del> [Edit (December 14, 2022): <a href="../../downloads/221202-Pillai-preprint.pdf">Here</a> is the accepted version.]</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you need to calculate Pillai scores in R, I’ve got a two-part tutorial for you (<a href="../../blog/a-tutorial-in-calculating-vowel-overlap">here</a> and <a href="../../blog/vowel-overlap-in-r-advanced-topics">here</a>). I also did a blog post (<a href="../../blog/pillai-scores-dont-change-after-normalization">here</a>) about how Pillai scores don’t seem to change after normalization.</p>

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>On Thursday afternoon, Peggy Renwick, Jon Forrest, Lelia Glass, and I kicked off the ADS sessions with our presentation on English in Georgia. The four of us have been collaborating for about a year, pooling together datasets and sharing resources, on a project focusing on English in Georgia. This is our first talk showcasing some of our findings. Our results are largely descriptive at this point. Here are the main plots we used (in a fun dark mode!) split up by generation, gender, and ethnicity:</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">For those of you that were there, this was the one that was horribly Zoombombed!</span></div></div>

<p>At the ADS poster session on Friday, I presented a poster with two students, Jessica Shepherd and Auna Nygaard. As a bit of background, in <em>Speech in the Western States: Volume 2</em>, Fridland et al (2012:172) point out that pretty much every study of the front lax vowels in the Western US has been based on independent, isolated studies. Because each research collects and processes data their own way, it’s difficult to disentangle differences that may be due to region and differences that may be due to methodological choices. They say that “clearly, collecting the same type of data from all sites would be optimal in allowing us the most reliable cross-region assessment.”</p>
<p>This project is a direct response to that call. When I was a grad student I recruited people via Amazon Mechanical Turk to a bunch of recordings of people reading sentences and wordlists. In total, 212 people completed the task, scattered all across the Western US. This poster describes the first results from this project. As it turns out, our findings match the West’s description as exhibiting both “homogeneity and heterogeneity” (Fridland et al.&nbsp;2012:172). We find homogeneity in that most people have the LBMS to some degree and that education level and region weren’t statistically significant predictors. However, there’s a wide range of variation for the LBMS and <sc>ban</sc>-raising, with younger people and sometimes women appearing to lead both of these sound changes. Here are some sample plots from four representative speakers.</p>

<p>Finally, on Friday afternoon, Lisa Johnson and I talked about vowel trajectories and what they can tell us about vowel merger. We look at prelaterals in rural Utah and find that, on the surface, they look like mergers by approximation. However, when we looked at the trajectories (with the help of some pretty cool animations!), it seems like the lateral gradually increases its influence on the vowel so that the merger happens “leftward,” from the coda to the onset. In this example, we have <sc>zeal</sc> and <sc>guilt</sc>, representing /il/ (<em>feel</em>, <em>deal</em>, <em>meal</em>) and /ɪl/ (<em>fill</em>, <em>dill</em>, <em>mill</em>), <a href="../../blog/extending-wells-lexical-sets-to-prelateral-vowels">respectively.</a></p>

<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/ads-and-lsa-2022/lsa2022_WOLF-MULCH.gif" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This was a pretty consistent pattern across all the pairs of prelateral vowels we looked at. We suspect that we might find this among other conditioned and vowel shifts, like prevelar raising, the <sc>mary-merry-marry</sc> merger, and post-coronal /u/-fronting. The point is, we think trajectories should be considered more when looking at vowel mergers because even among these supposed monophthongs, trajectories really illuminated how that merger happened.</p>

<p>I’m in Seattle at the 181st Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America right now! This is my first in-person conference since October 2019, so it’s great to be here. I presented two posters today, which you can read about and download below.</p>
<p><br></p>
<section id="beyond-midpoints-vowel-dynamics-of-the-low-back-merger-shift" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="beyond-midpoints-vowel-dynamics-of-the-low-back-merger-shift">Beyond Midpoints: Vowel Dynamics of the Low-Back-Merger Shift</h2>

</div>
<p>For some reason, I hadn’t yet presented any of my dissertation findings at a conference, not even while I was working on them or writing them up. Anyway, I’m happy to finally present some of my results at a conference. The purpose of this paper is to describe changes in vowel trajectory that accompany changes in midpoints. The Low-Back-Merger Shift is a now-widespread shift across much of North America. My data from Washington shows it pretty clearly across generations. But when I take a wide-angle lens at the vowel trajectories, I found that there was much more to the story than just a global lowering/centralizing of the front lax vowels.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/asa181/asa2021_trajs.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>There were perhaps three patterns I noticed when I modeled vowel trajectories. First is that the trajectory length was different between them. The low vowel /æ/ was much longer, then /ɛ/, and then /ɪ/. There’s also a general U-shaped pattern. Finally, the “angle” of this U-shaped was more towards the “left” for /æ/, more towards the right for /ɪ/, and in the middle for /ɛ/. These descriptions are consistent across generations and between the two geneders modeled, so it may say more about American English articulation than anything sociolinguistic.</p>
<p>Perhaps more interestingly though was <em>how</em> these trajectories changed—within the parameters just described—across generations. Older people’s vowels traversed through much more of the F2 space than younger generations did. The result is that the older people’s vowels look more like a shallow U-shape while the younger people’s is more of V-shape or even a “bounce” straight up and down in the F1-F2 vowel space. The fact that this was consistent across all three front lax vowels and between the genders suggests some interesting sociolinguistic change.</p>
<p>At this point, this is largely descriptive work. I don’t know how perceptible these differences are and I’m not even sure if everything I just described is statistically significant. It’ll take additional work to confirm both of these. Trajectories are often ignored because they’re chalked up articulatory causes; are we comfortable saying that trajectories are 100% phonetic and 0% sociolinguistic? (Meanwhile, if I may be a bit snarky, are the arbitrary single-point measurements that are typically analyzed magically sociolinguistically important?) I think people can exploit trajectories for sociolinguistic purposes. I just don’t know how or to what extent yet.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>I’m very excited about this Pillai scores paper with a new colleague, <a href="https://betsysneller.github.io">Betsy Sneller</a>! The background for this papers is that a while ago I was analyzing some <em>cot-caught</em> merger data I had collected. I noticed that, without exception, I got higher pillai scores in wordlists than I did in conversational data. I thought I had stumbled upon some interesting style shifting! But it was <em>too</em> clean of a pattern, so I did some digging and found that it’s likely because of the sample size between the two subsets. I had less data from the wordlists than I did from the conversation. I hypothesized then that less data leads to higher Pillai scores.</p>
<section id="methods-and-experiements" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methods-and-experiements">Methods and Experiements</h3>
<p>So in this paper, we test this hypothesis specifically by running a bunch of simulations. We started with a single bivariate normal distribution. We then randomly drew 5 numbers from that distribution and called it “group 1.” We then drew another 5 numbers from the <em>exact same distribution</em> and called it “group 2.” The fact that they’re drawn from the same underlying distribution represents a true underlying vowel merger. We then calculated the Pillai score of those two groups. We repeated with these group sizes 1000 times. Then we drew 6 tokens from each group 100 times and calcualted Pillai scores. Then 7. And all the way up to 100.</p>
<p>As seen in the main figure in the poster (slightly modified below), the results were clear: the larger the sample sizes, the lower the Pillai scores were. In theory, the Pillai scores should all be around zero since they’re from the same distribution. But with small samples sizes (&lt;10) observations per group, we very often got pretty high Pillai scores—scores that some researchers have considered to be distinct. It took around 30 observations per group to reliably (meaning 95% of the time) get the Pillai score under the somewhat conservative threshold of 0.1. It took 60 observations per group to get Pillai scores reliably below 0.05. This was concerning to us because few sociophonetic studies have sample sizes that large!</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/asa181/asa2021_equal.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>We were also concerned about unequal sample sizes betwen groups. So we reran the experiment, except the group sizes weren’t the same size. Each group could be anywhere from 5 to 100 observations, and we ran all 9000 or so combinations. The results were surprising to us—unequal group sizes doesn’t matter at all. The only thing that mattered was the total sample size. You can see this in the figure in the top right of the poster (or below): as you go from bottom-left to top-right, the average log Pillai score<span class="sidenote">We used log(pillai) because it worked better for this visual and for the math.</span> goes from high to low. But the fact that there is no pattern from the top-left to the bottom-right diagonal means that unequal sizes don’t matter.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/asa181/asa2021_unequal.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>

<p>In other words, if Group A has 25 observations and Group B has 5, the Pillai score will average around 0.07. That’s the same as if you had two groups of 15. If Group A has 25 observations and Group B has 100, the Pillai score will average around 0.01. That’s the same as if you had two groups of 62.</p>
</section>
<section id="implications" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implications">Implications</h3>
<p>We can think of a <em>lot</em> of implications for these findings. For one, mergers are probably underreported and splits/distinctions are probably overreported. This is because many sociophonetic studies run Pillai scores on somewhat smaller samples.</p>
<p>Because of sample size differences, comparison across studies is difficult. A study that collects lots of data per person will likely report lower Pillai scores than a study that is based on fewer observations per person.</p>
<p>Going back to the main impetus for this paper, comparison <em>within</em> studies is difficult. Since more careful speech styles typically elicit fewer observations, <strong>reading tasks will have higher Pillai scores than conversational data</strong>. To a naive researcher, this will be interpreted as style differences, when it is really just a reflection of the underlying math! This is such an important point and you can count on hearing more from me and Betsy about this in later venues.</p>
<p>Finally, one way to overcome the sample size difference is to look at the <em>p</em>-value that comes out the MANOVA test that the Pillai score came from. These <em>p</em>-values do seem to be reported in more phonetics-oriented papers, but for some reason they’re not in sociophonetics papers. So rather than us coming up with arbitrary and ad hoc thresholds for what a merged Pillai score should be, let’s us the <em>p</em>-value instead. Not reporting this <em>p</em>-value, to me at least, is kinda like reporting a <em>t</em>-statistic or <em>F</em>-ratio but without the accompanying <em>p</em>-value.</p>
<p>As a final note, and this is more of an after-thought for us, I wonder if it would be more helpful to report log(pillai) rather than raw pillai scores. Since Pillai ranges from 1 (completely distinct) to 0 (complete overlap), log Pillai would range from 0 (completely distinct) to negative infinity (complete overlap). In practical terms, it would mostly be betwen 0 and around –4 (the latter corresponding to a raw Pillai score of about 0.01). We’ll probably talk more about this in other venues so stay tuned for that.</p>

<p>I’m at New Ways of Analyzing Variation 49 online right now! Other than an quick online satellite session of LabPhon last summer, I haven’t attended a conference since November 2019 when we hosted LCUGA at UGA. Anyway, I’m excited to be conferencing again and while I miss seeing colleagues in-person, this online format isn’t bad. Anyway, on this page you’ll find links to the slides and YouTube videos of my two talks.</p>

<p>I’m very excited and nervous about this Order of Operations one. As it turns out, even if you start with the exact same spreadsheet and use the exact same functions, if you do those function in different orders, it’ll produce different results. Sometimes drastically different results. I did this by processing a spreadsheet 5,040 unique ways and got a whole range of results. To me at least, it’s making me rethink how I process my data and how I can interpret others’ results when the order isn’t explicitly reported in the methods section of a paper.</p>

<p>As a continuation of some work I did as a grad student, <a href="http://faculty.franklin.uga.edu/mrenwick/">Peggy Renwick</a> and I presented our research on Georgia English vowels and how they’ve changed over 100 years. Basically, all of them have. The Southern Vowel Shift seems to have undergone a rise and fall, perhaps peaking in those born around WWII. Meanwhile, back vowels are fronting. Younger people today have something like the Low-Back-Merger Shift, but flavored with some Southernisms still. You’ll hear more about this project in later conferences too.</p>

  <title>#365 Papers (Update)</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>
  <link>https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/365-papers-update/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>At the beginning of 2018, I set the ambitious goal of reading 365 papers during that year. I <a href="https://twitter.com/joey_stan/status/971972160322387968?s=20">tweeted</a> about it and <a href="../../blog/365-papers">blogged</a> about it, but ultimately didn’t achieve my goal. Turns out 365 is a lot. Well, after 1338 days, I can finally say I’ve ready 365 papers! So here’s just some visuals to see what kinds of things I’ve been reading.</p>
<p>What counts as a “paper” and what counts as “reading” it? I didn’t have any hard and fast rules, but these were the guidelines I laid out before starting.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Chapters are okay</em>: I think that in addition to journal articles, chapters from either edited volumes, monographs, or dissertations count as one each.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Notes are required</em>: I like to take a lot of notes while I read things, so I’ll only count it if I dutifully summarize and take notes as I go along. This means that skimming an article doesn’t count. If I’ve already read an article but for whatever reason didn’t take notes, I’ll only count it if I go through it again and take notes.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Conferences don’t count</em>: At least for me, attending a conference and taking notes there doesn’t count, and neither does going through the slides/poster if available. Not that there’s anything wrong with conferences, but this is #365<em>papers</em> after all.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In a few cases, I counted full books as a single entry, like if they had short chapters. I think a 3-page chapter of a book shouldn’t count the same as an article in <em>Language</em>, for example. Similarly, a lot of the Masters Theses I read were shorter and about the same as an article reading so those counted as one.</p>
<p>I will say that <em>re-reading</em> something counts a second time if I do it just as thoroughly. Things like textbook chapters from classes I’m teaching are the main culprit, but it’s nice to revisit things after a few years.</p>
<p>And to be clear, this doesn’t represent <em>all</em> the papers I’ve ever read. In fact, I’d say the bulk of reading for my dissertation happened before I started keeping track. I’ve kept decent notes about what I’ve read since about 2010, but I’ll just focus on the most recent 365 for now.</p>
<section id="pace" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pace">Pace</h2>
<p>If I wanted to read 365 papers in a year, that’s obviously one paper a day. What was my actual pace and did it change? The following plot answers this. From left to right are the months of the year. The colored lines go up as I finished a paper that year. In dashed gray lines, I have benchmarks for where the colored lines would be if I had maintained a constant rate.</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/365-papers-update/pace.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Looks like in 2018 and 2019 (when I was in the throes of dissertation-writing), my pace was usually somewhere around one paper every 4 to 8 days. So about one a week or occasionally two a week, on average. Starting in 2020 and continuing into this year, my pace is quicker and I’m reading a paper at least every three days on average.</p>
<p>My pace ebbed and flowed within a single year quite a bit and it’s interesting to see the patterns. In August of 2018 for example, I started really hunkering down and writing my dissertation, so there’s a sudden increase in pace (in the blue line). In early 2019 you can see I read in short bursts (I binge-read several 3rd Wave sociolinguistics papers). In June 2019 I took GIS and Stats courses so that uptick was from those classes. In September I was in a data visualization phase. And it looks like the time between when I submitted my dissertation and when I defended it (in December 2019), I didn’t do much reading at all.</p>
<p>My pace went up quite a bit in 2020 as I was transitioning from dissertation work to teaching. I read some material related to my job talk and was working on submitting my chapter in <em>Speech in the Western States: Volume III</em>. The biggest jump was in March 2020. Yes, that’s when COVID hit, but I was also fortunate to be hired as an “instructional designer” for BYU so I was prepping a course and doing a <em>lot</em> of reading. Things waned as I moved to Utah but when Fall semester hit, I kept that pretty quick pace up as I was prepping two new courses. This continued into 2021 as I prepped another two new courses. And you can see my recent uptick as I start getting ready to teach again.</p>
</section>
<section id="content" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="content">Content</h2>
<p>So now that we’ve got the pace covered, let’s look at the content itself.</p>
<section id="years" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="years">Years</h3>
<p>First, I’ll show the publication years of the things I read. Note that I do have two colums for “no date” and forthcoming: those are mostly reviews I did or other sneak-peaks at unpublished work.</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/365-papers-update/years.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I’m happy to see that a large proportion of what I read was recent, having come out since I started this little project. Looks like half of the papers I read came out in 2008 or later (or rather, within the last 10–14 years); a third was 2017 or later (the last 1–4 years). I honestly wish I had read even more recent stuff though because I feel a little behind the times. A quarter of what I read was before 1993. It’s good to read the classics, but I think I need to be staying more up to date though. Something that certainly accounts for this older skew is that I read while walking and the things I read are typically older (Trudgill 1978, Petyt 1980, Preston 1989, etc). I’m happy I read some older things, but I wish this plot had been more skewed towards the right.</p>
</section>
<section id="topics" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="topics">Topics</h3>
<p>Next, here’s a plot of the broad topic the papers fell in. I only gave each paper a single tag, and sometimes the decision to call something sociolinguistics vs dialectology, for example, was somewhat arbitrary. But this should give you a rough idea of what things I read.</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/365-papers-update/tags.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>It should come to no surprise that most of what I read was sociolinguistic in nature, followed closely by dialectology. The socio stuff is relevant to research and teaching and the dialectology stuff is mostly for research. Phonetics and statistics coming next are also exactly what I’d expect. I wish I had a bit wider range of topics though so that I can be more well-rounded of a linguist.</p>
</section>
<section id="publication-type" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="publication-type">Publication Type</h3>
<p>Next, here’s a basic plot on the publication type. I’ve divided everything into three broad categories: journal articles (which include conference proceedings), monographs, and edited volumes.</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/365-papers-update/pub_type.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This is where I think I fall short. I’m happy to see that journal articles were the most common, but I think I should be reading a higher proportion of newer articles than I am. In fact, monographs and edited volumes combined make up 54% of what I read. This may also be because I read as I walk to and from my car and around my building, so I do get more regular book-reading time than sit-and-read-an-article time.</p>
</section>
<section id="publication-venue" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="publication-venue">Publication Venue</h3>
<p>Finally, the publication venue. Just focusing on the journal articles, here’s a list of the venues I read from the most. (I’ve filtered out venues that I only read from once or twice, for space issues).</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/365-papers-update/venue.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Based on my research, it should come as no surprise that <em>American Speech</em> and <em>LVC</em> are the top two. I have a print subscription to <em>American Speech</em>, and I had a habit of reading through all the articles while on the bus. My guess is that the <em>PWPL</em> ones are mostly proceedings from NWAV too. <em>JASA</em>, <em>JEngL</em>, and <em>J. Soc.</em> are also not much of a surprise.</p>
<p>However, this plot again highlights what I think are my shortcomings. I feel like I need to be reading more <em>Language in Society</em> and <em>Journal of Sociolinguistics</em>. I also think I need to be reading about languages other than English too. I feel like I’ve latched on to my venues to my detriment and I’m missing a lot of interesting work by not expanding my horizons.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="outlook" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outlook">Outlook</h2>
<p>I’m glad I did this exercise ad I’ll certainly continue with it. And looking back at the past 3⅔ years has been enlightening to say the least. My goals for the next 365 papers are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read a larger proportion of journal articles. Specifically, I want to go from 45% journal articles to 65%.</p></li>
<li><p>Read a larger proportion of newer articles. Specifically, I want over half of what I read to be since 2015 (6–9 years old).</p></li>
<li><p>Finish 365 papers sooner. It took 44 months to do this first batch. Since I’ve been keeping a pretty good pace of a paper every three days, I’ll aim for 36 months and finish by August 31, 2024.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I also want to get through my to-read list. I have about 50 papers on it. It is always growing, and as I read more I find more things to read. But my current list has been nagging me so I want to knock out a bunch of those.</p>

  <title>Kohler Tapes</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>
  <link>https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/kohler-tapes/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>So, I just acquired a goldmine of data that I can use for linguistic analysis. Sitting in my office are 452 cassette tapes, each containing at least 30 minutes of recorded interviews with an older folks from Heber City, Utah. And that’s about half of the collection: the other half is with a historian in Midway, Utah. So, I’m looking at roughly 400–500 hours of audio. Not sure how I’m going to process it all, but I wanted to kick off the beginning of this long-term project with a blog post describing the history of the tapes, why I’m interested in them, and speculations about the future.</p>

</div>
<section id="background" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I first heard about the tapes a little over three years ago. In January 2018, the LSA annual meeting was in Salt Lake City. Wanting to take advantage of the trip out there, I applied for and received a grant from the University of Georgia to collect audio in Heber City, aiming for multiple generations within a family to track language change over time. I decided on Heber partly because it was a region of Utah that had never been the subject of acoustic (let alone linguistic) analysis, as far as I know. My parents were living there at the time too, so they could hook me up with some potential contacts.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>So on the morning of the first day of my fieldwork, the first thing I did was go to the Heber Valley Visitor’s Center as a way to potentially find some contacts. Literally the first person I talked to told me about a man who had a huge collection of tapes. One person led me to another, and I was talking to an elderly man named Norm Kohler in his nursing home.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">Side note, it’s amazing that I heard about this goldmine <em>literally</em> through the first person I talked to while doing fieldwork? Who knew that there’d be such an amazing collection of audio sitting in someone’s basement nearby? In fact, there could be lots of collections like these, just collecting dust in people’s basements. All it takes is to find the right person!</span></div></div>
<p>Norm was a beloved middle school teacher in Heber City in the 1980s and 1990s. As a history project, he had each of his students get a cassette tape and interview a grandparent. I don’t know what the interview questions were, but I think they mostly concerned life in Heber Valley. He kept all the tapes his students turned in and, over the course of two decades, he ended up with over 1200 interviews! Norm intended to compile them and put together an oral history of the town, but unfortunately was unable to do so. So, just weeks before I met him, he decided it was best to return the tapes to the family members’ of his students and the people they interviewed. So he put an ad in the paper and hundreds of people claimed their tapes and were able to hear their ancestors’ voices, perhaps for the first time.</p>
<p>However, not all the tapes were claimed. I was told a few hundred remained. So, after Norm passed away a few months later, his family held on to them for a while before finally donating them to the Midway Historical Society. (Midway is the town next door to Heber.) Several complications made it difficult for me to get access to the tapes, including outdated contact information on Midway’s website, the society going on an extended hiatus, me living in Georgia, and then covid. But I did my best to reach out to anyone who might know about where the tapes were being stored.</p>
<p>Finally, on Thursday this week, I was contacted by the historian in custody of the tapes. She asked if I was still interested in them, and I most definitely am! So we had a nice chat about what my goals were for them and what the goals were for the Historical Society, and we think there’s mutual interest in getting them digitized and transcribed. So, the next day, yesterday, she happened to be in Provo so she dropped off about half of the tapes—452 of them!—at my office!</p>
<p>So after three years of following tenuous leads, I finally have the tapes!</p>
</section>
<section id="why-am-i-so-interested" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-am-i-so-interested">Why am I so interested?</h2>
<p>I am a linguist, so why should I care about these tapes? Well, the obvious reason is that it’s a <em>lot</em> of audio. For my dissertation I analyzed about 40 hours of interviews and that was already a lot of data. This is at least 10 times the amount of audio. In fact, it’s about the size of the <em>Digital Archive of Southern Speech</em>, a subset of the <em>Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States</em>, that I spent four years in grad school analyzing. So having access to this much audio is absolutely incredible.</p>
<p>But it’s not just the amount of audio. There are dozens of oral history projects even in Utah. This particular set is attractive for several reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The nature of the homework assignment ensured good metadata. A few tapes have already been digitized and they all start off introducing the interviewer (the middle-schooler) and the interviewee, with information like the date of interview, their age, and where they grew up.</p></li>
<li><p>Because these were all students in the same smallish town in Utah the sample will be relatively homogeneous geographically. While it doesn’t ensure that the interviewees (the grandparents) were from Heber or Heber Valley generally, my guess is that a significant number of them are.</p></li>
<li><p>Typically, interviews happen with a historian or someone that the interviewer is unfamiliar with. In sociolinguistics, it’s generally accepted that the degree of familiarity with the interviewer can have an influence on a person’s speech. In all cases with these tapes, the interviewer is a teenager and a grandchild of the interviewee. So that lowers the formality of the situation and will likely mean that the interviewees’ speech will be more casual.</p></li>
<li><p>Heber Valley has been the focus of very little acoustic research. There may be occasional interviews as parts of the Linguistic Atlas Project or the <em>Dictionary of Regional American English</em>, but no study, as far as I know, has focused on Heber. Instead, most research looks at people from Utah Valley and Salt Lake Valley. This collection of interviews will offer a new spot on the map of Utah dialectology and a nice point of comparison between more urban and more rural areas of the state.</p></li>
<li><p>I have virtually no metadata about the interviewees right now, but if their grandchildren were about 14 years old in the 1980s and 1990s, then the speakers in these tapes were born perhaps sometime between 1900 and 1940. There has been some research on the development of Utah English, mostly by David Bowie, but he acknowledges that it was based on public sermons given by upper-class white men. This collection offers a unique look into how other Utahns born around that time talked. And since I have some comparable data from contemporary Heber City residents, I can begin to look at language change in real time.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">There were about 4500 people living in Heber in the 1980s and 1990s, which means this sample is a significant chunk of the community!</span></div><p>So there are lots of reasons for why I’m really interested in this collection of tapes. And that’s on top of the oral history the Midway Historical Society wants to create based on them.</p>
</section>
<section id="looking-ahead" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>Luckily, I’ve had some experience working on a project of this size. For four years at the University of Georgia, I was a part of the team that processed the <a href="http://www.lap.uga.edu/Site/DASS.html"><em>Digital Archive of Southern Speech</em></a>, which is a 367-hour subset of the <em>Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States</em>. So I’ve sat in on transcriber training sessions, seen what kinds of obstacles get in the way of processing, managed thousands of files, and analyzed spreadsheets with a couple million acoustic measurements in them. However, that was only as a graduate student. I’m sure there’s a lot that goes on behind the scenes as a PI that I didn’t see.</p>
<p><em>Transcribers</em>—Some back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that I’ll need a sizable grant to get this all processed. Again, I don’t have definite numbers for anything, I know my 452 tapes are a little over half of them, so let’s say there are 700 tapes total. They’re all at least 30 minutes long and I know many went longer, so if I average say 40 minutes per tape, that’s 28,000 minutes or roughly 467 hours. I think the the transcribers for <em>DASS</em> averaged about 13 hours per 50 minutes of audio or so, but this audio is newer and I presume Utah transcribers will be more familiar with Utah speakers I think, so I’ll estimate 10 hours of work per tape. That’s 4670 hours of transcription. At $15 per hour, I’m looking at about $70,000 in student wages. Obviously, I can’t get that much coin internally so it sounds like this is only going to happen with an external grant.</p>
<p><em>Grad student workers</em>—That’s of course assuming that the only wages I’ll need to pay for are transcribers. This might be getting into “If you give a mouse a cookie” territory, but it would be nice to have some grad students helping out with the project. At UGA, we had at least four and as many as six grad students involved in the project at a time. There was a lot of overlap between our duties, but very roughly speaking, one managed the transcribers, one managed the spot-checks, one managed the acoustic analysis, and one did miscellaneous duties. We were all involved in analysis, and a few others popped in for a semester or two to do additional analysis or perform other duties. To lighten my load, it would be handy to have perhaps three grad students manage the transcribers, check their work, and do the acoustic analysis. I’m fuzzy on what costs are associated with RA-ships at BYU, but I do know it’ll add significantly to the total cost of the project.</p>
<p><em>Time</em>—How long will transcriptions take? I’ve done transcriptions and they’re soul-sucking work. Even when I was highly motivated to process my own dissertation data, that I collected myself, and under a bit of a time crunch, I could barely put in more than about two hours a day. I surely don’t expect undergraduate transcribers to do more than 10 hours a week. When motivated by money, I’ve seen some at UGA do more, but those students were exceptional. I’ll estimate five hours of work per transcriber per week. So under the assumption of 4670 hours of work total, that’s 934 transcriber-weeks. If a semester is fifteen weeks, that’s 62 transcriber-semesters. If I set a goal of getting all the work done in two years (six semesters if you include summers), it would take ten or eleven transcribers to do it in two years. Of course, these are all very rough estimates, but managing several tens of thousands of dollars and almost a dozen workers for two years is not something I expected to do right away!</p>
<p><em>Digitizing</em>—Regardless of the cost, number of workers, and time involved, the first step of the process will be digitization. Fortunately, it sounds like the Office of Digital Humanities can take care of that for me! Wow! So my short term goal is to get a batch—maybe 30 or 50 tapes—done first. While they work on digitizing the next batch, I can get started on listening to the first few minutes of the completed tapes and extracting whatever metadata I can from them. Eventually, all the tapes will be digitized and I can have a more concrete idea of how much audio (and consequently, people, time, hours, and money) I’m looking at.</p>
<p><em>Metadata</em>—After digitizing all of them, my next step will be to finish collecting the metadata. It’ll be nice to have a clear picture of birth years, genders, and birthplaces for all 700 or so people. The most likely scenario is that I <em>won’t</em> get an external grant because they’re extremely competitive, so I’ll have to prioritize which ones to transcribe first. The Historical Society would like to start with some of the prominent members of the community and descendants of the town’s founders. I’d like to find a balance of genders and birth years too, so we’ll probably settle on a subset that satisfies both of our needs. How big? I’m thinking between 35 and 70 (5% to 10% of the tapes). That’s a more reasonably-sized project that I could possibly get funded internally. It could provide me at least a beginning look at the speech community which would help seed an external grant.</p>
<p><em>Follow-up project?</em>—In case I just need more data to analyze (ha!) wouldn’t it be cool to track down some of the tapes that were given away? Presumably, if an ad in the paper is what it took for the families to get them, then an ad might be a good place to start to find them. We’d digitize the tapes right there for people, give them a copy and return the tape to them of course, but then also add that to the collection for the oral history. I think it would be especially cool to interview those people themselves! That way we can get some contemporary data to compare the tapes to, as well as track change within the family. That’ll have to wait until I get NSF grant number two!</p>
<p><em>Publications</em>—What’s the end goal? Well, I’ll obviously start cranking out some papers as soon as a reasonable amount of data has been processed. There is a <em>lot</em> going on in Utah English. Many of the stereotyped features are dying out, so these people may provide good acoustic data for what would otherwise be hard to study phonetically today. But there are also lots of other features that I believe are recent innovations, so if they’re infrequent or missing from these speakers, it’ll help establish the timing of when they did develop. Even before I had the tapes, I’ve been thinking a full analysis of this collection deserves a book-length treatment. It likely won’t get done before I’m up for tenure, but maybe it’ll go towards my application for full professor.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The history of the Kohler Tapes is pretty cool, and I’m lucky to be a part of the creation of an oral history of Heber City. It’s so satisfying teaming up with a historical society and finding ways to help the community I’m studying too. Linguistically, they’re interesting to me for lots of reasons, but I think everyone benefits from seeing these tapes get processed. As far as how I’m going to go about processing all of them, I really have no idea what I’m doing so there will be a lot of learning involved. But I’m excited to be involved and to have a clear research trajectory for the next decade or so!</p>

<p>For the first time in a few years, I did not attend the ADS/LSA annual meetings. It would have been nice to hang out in New Orleans this weekend. However, my research will still be represented: my colleagues presented some research focusing on Southern American English vowels that I’ve been a part of this year.</p>

<p>Friday morning at the American Dialect Society poster session, Bill Kretzschmar presented some research on behalf of the entire Linguistic Atlas research team at UGA (Peggy Renwick, Katie Kuiper, Lisa Lipani, Mike Olsen, Rachel Olsen, and me). In it he presents findings from our now-complete dataset from the <em>Digital Archive of Southern Speech</em>. With a dataset this size, we can make comparisons to other varieties of American English regarding the distribution of vowels in the F1-F2 space.</p>

<p>Sunday, <a href="http://faculty.franklin.uga.edu/mrenwick/">Peggy Renwick</a> presented our research on formant dynamics of back vowels in Southern American English vowels. Focusing on just the White Americans in the <em>Digital Archive of Southern Speech (DASS)</em>, we wanted to see how formant trajectory shapes and their relative positions vary across male and female speakers in different generations. Many of our findings can be summarized in this animation:</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/ads-and-lsa-2020/lsa2020.gif" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><sc>goose</sc> doesn’t change much, especially for the women, suggesting <sc>goose</sc> fronting is an old shift and was nearing completion by the time our speakers acquired language. Meanwhile <sc>goat</sc> lowers between the Lost and GI generations of women, and then a generation later for the men. <sc>foot</sc> doesn’t change much, suggesting it doesn’t pattern with <sc>goose</sc>-fronting. The low vowels <sc>lot</sc> and <sc>thought</sc> are near each other, but not merged because of their different positions in the F1-F2 space and their different formant shapes.</p>
<p>Something that stands out to me is that each vowel’s trajectory didn’t change all that much over time. This wasn’t a product of how our GAMM was specified: each combination of vowel, sex, and generation was interacted and therefore, fit independently of the other. So the fact that the trajectories show remarkable stability is really interesting to me. So, at least among these DASS speakers, Southern American English vowels appear to shift the nucleus and glide in tandem.</p>

<p>I presented at the 6th annual Linguistics Conference at UGA today! My presentation, which was called “Real Time Vowel Shifts in Georgia English” compared Georgians born around the 1890s to those born in the 1990s—100 years of change! The gist: nearly every vowel has changed, and it seems like the trajectory of that change is in the direction of the Elsewhere Shift, rather than just a simple recession of Southern features.</p>

<p>The data came from two very different sources. The older speakers, were born between 1887 and 1903, were recorded doing Linguistic Atlas interviews and are part of the <em>Digital Archive of Southern Speech</em>. The younger speakers, who were born between 1994 and 1997) were UGA undergraduates that I recorded as they read sentences in a lab. Two very different datasets, but they’re all Georgian natives, so it starts to give us a glimpse into how things have changed around here.</p>
<p>Here’s a summary of the changes I found.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><sc>price</sc> was monophthongal for older speakers and definitely a diphthong in the younger speakers.</p></li>
<li><p>The Euclidean distance between <sc>fleece</sc> and <sc>kit</sc> and between <span class="smallcaps">face</span> and <sc>dress</sc> was grew over 100 years, suggesting the younger speakers’ vowels are not as “Southern” sounding.</p></li>
<li><p>While the older speakers’ <sc>lot</sc> and <sc>thought</sc> were close, the younger speakers’ were almost entirely merged.</p></li>
<li><p>The front lax vowels, <sc>trap</sc>, <sc>dress</sc>, and <sc>kit</sc> were front and monophthongal in the older speakers while the younger speakers realized them more centralized and more diphthongal. <sc>trap</sc> underwent the most change, then <sc>dress</sc>, and then <sc>kit</sc>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="smallcaps">goose</span> was centralized even in the older speakers, but the younger speakers took it further by using an even more fronted onset.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This animation basically sums up the entire talk. Plus I just had fun making animations! Here’s the change for the women.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/lcuga6/georgia_animation_female.gif" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>

<p>And here’s the change for the men.</p>

<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/lcuga6/georgia_animation_male.gif" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Overall, it appears that it’s not just that the younger speakers lack features associated with the South, it’s that they’re also using realizations characteristic of other regions like California and Canada. It makes sense, since Atlanta is a large metropolitan area and is kind of known as a non-Southern city in the middle of the South. But this might be an indication that the Elsewhere Shift has made its way into the South.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Some of you may have noticed that at the bottom of a lot of the pages on my website, I’ve got this button:</p>
<center>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ko-fi.com/widgets/widget_2.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">kofiwidget2.init('Buy me a Coffee', '#376092', 'E1E1OQ2R');kofiwidget2.draw();</script> 
</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>I’ve created an account on <a href="https://ko-fi.com">ko-fi.com</a>, which is a platform that, in their words, provides “a friendly way for fans to support your work for the price of a coffee.” To put it more bluntly, I’ve created a way for people to give me money for my tutorials and stuff. At the risk of sounding arrogant, I’ll brag for just a little bit before geeking out about the new books I’ve gotten because of that little button.</p>
<section id="let-me-brag-for-just-a-sec" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="let-me-brag-for-just-a-sec">Let me brag for just a sec</h2>
<p>So I’ve put together half a dozen tutorials and another dozen or so workshops. The most popular ones are the tutorials on how to make vowel plots, how do formant extraction, measuring vowel overlap, and my series of R workshops. You can find them all on my <a href="../../resources">Resources</a> page.</p>
<p>These were skills that aren’t typically taught in a linguistics course, but they’re expected of sociophoneticians, and I knew I had to learn how to do them. So, I hunkered down, did <em>lots</em> of googling, and figured out this stuff on my own by frankensteining what I could find from lots of other pages online. After a while, word spread among my peers that I had acquired some skills, and I ended up helping lots of people do these things on their own data.</p>
<p>Eventually, I realized that there was a niche to be filled: my peers could benefit from a clear tutorial on some basic scripting techniques in sociophonetics. So, I started to write the tutorials that I wish I had had when I was learning this stuff. When I finish them, I share them on Twitter, and they’ve consistently remained among my most visited pages on my website. People from about ten different countries on four continents have contacted me for various reasons, explaining how useful they’ve found the tutorials. And there are likely many more anonymous folks too.</p>
<p>Since then, lots of other people have produced excellent tutorials that cover some of the same topics mine have. And that’s awesome! I’m just glad that people have so many resources available to them to learn these skills.</p>
</section>
<section id="so-whats-this-ko-fi-thing" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-whats-this-ko-fi-thing">So what’s this Ko-fi thing?</h2>
<p>So someone (I forget who) offhandedly mentioned that I should charge people for my tutorials. There was no way I was going to do that. I got this information for free, so I give it for free.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>But, I figured if people wanted to <em>donate</em> money, well, who was I to stop them? So I looked around and settled on Ko-fi as a way to give people that opportunity if they wanted to take it. It seems simple enough: the button above will take you to my Ko-fi page, and from there you can donate $3, or about the price of a coffee.  The money gets sent to my PayPal account and I can deposit into my bank account.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">Ironically, I don’t drink coffee, so you can think of it as a fancy glass bottle of Coca-Cola or something.</span></div></div>
<p>So I set it up, put and put it at the bottom of my tutorials, and didn’t think anything of it because I didn’t expect much to happen. But slowly, here and there—and much to my surprise—the donations came in. It’s not bumping me up to the next tax bracket or anything, but it does make me feel that the work I put into the tutorials is appreciated.</p>
<p><em>Update: Now that I’m faculty, I have a real salary, and I feel back taking money from people, especially grad students. But, I’ve been told that sometimes people appreciate having a way to express their appreciation.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="what-am-i-doing-with-the-money" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-am-i-doing-with-the-money">What am I doing with the money?</h2>
<p>Instead of just dumping it into my bank account, I figure I should do something special with the money. I decided to get a couple books. In particular, I wanted to get some books on data visualization, since that’s relevant to the tutorials themselves.</p>
<p>My first goal was <em>Data Visualization</em> by Kieren Healy. I had been following the book as it was approaching publication and was excited to see it’s positive reception. Yes, it’s pretty much all available online, but I wanted the physical copy for two reasons. For one, it’s a beautiful book and a paragon of excellence in typography. But also, I should return the favor of financially supporting someone who produces tutorials online. Thanks to one large donation that bumped me well past my goal, I’m now a proud owner of Healy’s book!</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/thank-you/joey_healy.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="width:85.0%"></p>
<p>So I tweeted about it and did a small humble brag. And again, much to my surprise, some more donations came in! So in the same week, I met my second goal of purchasing <em>Fundamentals of Data Visualization</em> by Claus O. Wilke.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p> <img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/thank-you/joey_wilke.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="width:85.0%"></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">I’m now realizing the front phone on my camera is quite fuzzy.</span></div></div>
<p>With these two books in hand, I hope my knowledge of data visualization will increase and that this percolates into future tutorials and workshops.</p>
<p>So I didn’t think this whole thing would work. Apparently it has. I’ve now started to compile a list of additional books I’d like to get, including Edward Tufte’s quartet of data visualization books, some linguistics books I’ve been meaning to get, and a couple statistics manuals.</p>
</section>
<section id="thank-you" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thank-you">Thank You</h2>
<p>The reason for all this is to say thank you. I’m so thrilled to hear that people seem to find some utility in my tutorials, and I’m humbled that some folks went out of their way to send me a little extra pocket money as a token of their appreciation. I’m honored to be helping the linguistics community in a small way. Thank you.</p>

  <title>Jealousy List 3</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This is the third iteration of my <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/damn-we-wish-wed-done-these-11-stories/">Jealousy List</a>, which is a list of articles so good I wish I had been the one to write them. My first two lists were posted about a year ago (see the list of lists <a href="../../blog/#category=Jealousy Lists">here</a>) and this one is long overdue, so I apologize for some of the posts being a little less recent. Regardless, here are a list of posts I’ve found in the past few weeks and months that I found exceptional in some way, entertaining, informative, or just plain cool.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/trashystats">Saskia Freytag</a></strong>. <a href="http://rpubs.com/Saskia/520216">“Workshop: Dimension reduction with R”</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
</p><p>So I wrote a tutorial on dimension reductions in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a>. It has actually turned out to be fairly comprehensive. It uses a fun example dataset on cereals (🎉 - not looking for at iris) I would love some feedback: <a href="https://t.co/VsiHX2KYdT">https://t.co/VsiHX2KYdT</a></p>

<p>You may have heard of PCA (Principle Components Analysis) as a way to reduce a bunch of variables down to a more manageable number. As it turns out, this is just one way to do a <em>dimension reduction</em> on your data. Freytag’s workshop does a really nice job at explaining some of the different dimension reduction techniques that are out there, including helpful plots for the visual learners out there. It also goes into detail about the pros and cons of each method, and gives some sample R code showing you how to run the analysis yourself. I wish there were more workshops like there floating around! Plus, it uses data from a bunch of cereals, and I’m pretty sure I’ve used that dataset before in my workshops…</p>

<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>This is a short blog post, but I really like it because is succinctly shows how to quickly produce a really complelling story with some data and a nice visual. It uses the <a href="https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/">tidycensus</a> package by <a href="http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/">Kyle Walker</a> to extract some information about median income and housing prices per US county, and then creates a stunning map to display the data. I also learned that the county I live in now, Clarke County, Georgia, was among the top 25 <em>worst</em> counties in the country in this regard. I guess that’s where all my money is going!</p>

<p>I’ve become a bit of a color snob, so I appreciate a good post on colors in data visualization. This one is less about the colors themselves, and more about how to more easily implement your own custom color scheme in ggplot2. Aden-Buie even goes so far as to provide helpful tips for when you compile all these custom commands into an R package. I’ll definitely be using this whenever I get my package off the ground.</p>

<p>Data visualization must have been on my mind for a while now, because five months ago I bookmarked this blog post so that it’d make it on my next Jealousy List. This is a nice critique about <em>Dynamite Plots</em>, or basically bar plots with those little error bars at the top. Basically, they obscure the underlying distribution and can be replaced by a very small table. Fortunately, the complaint comes with a few recommendations for alternative visuals.</p>

<p>There will probably always be at least one Julia Silge post on my Jealousy Lists. This one introduces a new R package, tidylo, which calculates weighted log odds using within the framework of the tidyverse. The post itself is, as always, a fun read and there are some great visuals. This’ll make it really easy to choose a baby name characteristic of like the 1920s for my next kid or something.</p></li>

<p><br></p>
<p>So that’s it for my long-overdue Jealousy List: statistical procedures, succinct tutorials, color, data visualization, and more statistics. Again, a decent representation of what I’ve been reading recently.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>At the Digital Humanities 2019 conference in Utrecht, the Netherlands, I presented with Bill Kretzschmar on ways to visualize a lot of phonetic data.</p>
<section id="the-gazetteer-of-southern-vowels" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-gazetteer-of-southern-vowels">The Gazetteer of Southern Vowels</h2>
<p>The first half of the presentation was essentially me showcasing the <em>Gazetteer of Southern Vowels</em> (or <em>GSV</em>), a website I created in Shiny to help visualize 1.3 million acoustic measurements from the <em>Digital Archive of Southern Speech</em>.<span class="sidenote-left">The full web address is <a href="http://lap3.libs.uga.edu/u/jstanley/vowelcharts/">http://lap3.libs.uga.edu/ u/jstanley/vowelcharts/</a>, but I’ve got a redirect at <a href="joeystanley.com/gsv">joeystanley.com/gsv</a> that’s easier to type.</span> In the talk I spend most of the time in the “Vowel Plot Comparison” tab (below) and show how you can interact with the data.</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/dh2019/side_by_side.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>First, you can subset the data by demographic factors. The <em>Speaker Selection</em> tab has menu items for speakers’ sex, age, ethnicity, home state, social class, and a couple other variables. When you select one or more of these, the plot automatically updates to reflect that subset.</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/dh2019/tab_speaker.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>You can also subset the data by linguistic factors. In the <em>Words</em> tab, you’ll see that a list of stopwords is displayed and that those are excluded by default. You can add to or remove words from that stoplist, or switch it so display only those words (or some other set of words like numbers or colors).</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/dh2019/tab_words.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In the <em>Vowels</em> tab, you’ve got a whole bunch of options. First, you can choose what vowel is being displayed, what kind of stress it can have, and what its phonetic environment is(based on following segment only). There are some methodological choices too, like ways of filtering and normalizing the data. You can also choose what transcription system is being used.</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/dh2019/tab_vowels.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Then, there are ways for you to customize the plot. The <em>Plot Style</em> tab as four main options (points, ellipses, means, and words), that act independently with their own controls for size and opacity. So if you want means and ellipses but no dots, you can do that. If you want to display the words themselves, but in a small font and transparent, be my guest.</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/dh2019/tab_plot_style.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The <em>Plot Customization</em> tab lets you change things like the zoom, axes, aspect ratio, and (some control over) colors. I’m hoping to add more options to this tab in the future. With these two tabs, I feel like you can make a lot of very different plots, all based on the same data, which is pretty cool.</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/dh2019/tab_plot_customization.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Finally, the <em>Download Options</em> is the newest tab. You could always take a screenshot, but you’re limited to how your web browser displays the image and your computer’s screensize. In this tab, you can set the height, width, quality, and format, so you can make publication-quality images. In fact, the plots in this blog post were all created using this download button, so you can recreate them yourself!</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/dh2019/tab_download.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>So that’s it! My goal in creating these options was to allow users to create any type of plot using any conceivable subset of DASS, and I think the GSV does a pretty good job at that. Here’s a quick gallery of six different plots:</p>
<p><img width="50%" style="float:left;" src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/dh2019/sample_points_big.jpeg"> <img width="50%" style="float:right;" src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/dh2019/sample_ellipse_means.jpeg"> <img width="50%" style="float:left;" src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/dh2019/sample_words_ellipse_means.jpeg"> <img width="50%" style="float:right;" src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/dh2019/sample_points_trans_means.jpeg"> <img width="50%" style="float:left;" src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/dh2019/sample_points_ellipse.jpeg"> <img width="50%" style="float:right;" src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/dh2019/sample_words_ellipse.jpeg"></p>
</section>
<section id="point-pattern-analysis" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="point-pattern-analysis">Point Pattern Analysis</h2>
<p>In the second half of the presentation, Bill Kretzschmar took over and discussed using point pattern analysis in the visualization of vowel data. He has found that when you overlay a grid on the F1-F2 space (just as geographers do with geospatial data), you can see the central tendency of vowels by which “cells” in this new grid are the densest. They roughly follow the 80-20 rule, with a few cells being heavy concentrated, some having some tokens, and many with very few. Here’s just one image of a Georgia man’s <sc>fleece</sc> vowel.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">Incidentally, because the grid itself is new element, there are additional controls in the <em>Plot Customization</em> tab, like how many cells and the opacity or size of the labels. And since there’s only one color being used, I’ve got controls over whether the shading is discrete or continuous, if it’s discrete then how many levels, and you can even put a custom color in hex notation. Also, I’m still working on getting the ranges in the legend to display integers only, since 54.6 data points in a cell is somewhat nonsensical.</span></div></div>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/dh2019/point_pattern.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Bill finds that if you plot them in order of density, the resulting curve is an asymptotic hyperbolic curve, or just A-curve for short. And, as it turns out, this distribution is fractal in nature, so regardless of how much you subset the data, you’ll find the same distribution. The <em>GSV</em> makes it easy to see this distributions interactively.</p>
<p>At the very end, we hinted at some additional visualizations we’d like to develop to make it easier to view trajectory data, taking advantage of a third-dimension in the plot itself. Hopefully, we’ll have more to say about that in the future.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So that’s our presentation! We’ve got a lot of data and we needed lots of plots to make sense of it all. Instead of saving plot after plot, we decided an interactive Shiny app might be a better option. Most importantly, I think we’ve learned a little more about how language works because of the size of the data and the interactivity of this tool.</p>

  <title>You’re a Statistician, Harry!</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The job hunt was not successful this year. I applied to about two dozen positions, got interviewed for five of them (yay!) but ultimately got zero offers (boo…). I’m disappointed, sure, but it’s probably for the best anyway: it took longer to write my dissertation than I anticipated, so it probably wouldn’t have been feasible to finish it and graduate by August. Plus, I have funding for one more year. But, the funny thing is I’m now in this weird position where the bulk of my dissertation has been written, but I have about another year left as a student. What can I during this time? I considered a lot of options, but I think I’ve settled on something fun: I’m going to try and get an M.S. in Statistics!</p>
<section id="how-is-this-possible" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-is-this-possible">How is this possible?</h2>
<p>As it turns out, UGA offers a <a href="https://www.stat.uga.edu/secondary-masters-degree-0">“secondary” Master’s degree in statistics</a>. It designed so that UGA students who are seeking degrees in other departments can walk away with a Master’s in statistics as well. I’d take the required courses, fill out some paperwork, write a thesis, and boom—I’ve got an MS. I wouldn’t be part of the statistics department so I’ll have to continue getting funded through my home department (linguistics), but I would get a full-fledged degree from them by the time I graduate.</p>
<p>I’ve known about this option for a while now, and the main thing holding me back was my lack of a strong mathematical background. I took calculus in high school and quite enjoyed it, but that was more than 10 years ago, and I’d actually need three semesters of calculus to be able to do well in some of the core stats courses. So I decided it was a nice thought but was ultimately not going to happen. When the realization came that I’d probably be around for another year though, I looked at the requirements, talked with the graduate coordinator, and put together a schedule. It’ll be a busy year, but I think I can make it work.</p>
<p>The math problem still hasn’t gone away, so my goal this summer is to fly through differential, integral, and multivariate calculus on my own before the semester starts in August. Fortunately, it looks like I can learn everything I need through <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>, which is awesome. I’m already auditing Mathematical Statistics during the summer so when take it for real in the fall I’ll know the material well enough to pass. So far, it has been coming back pretty quickly, so I feel pretty good about it all.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-bother" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-bother">Why bother?</h2>
<p>When I was weighing my options for what I could do during my last year, it was all based on how I could improve my job prospects for next year. My first and the most obvious option was to just hunker down and crank out a bunch of publications to lengthen that CV. This is a good plan, but ultimately I decided I probably wouldn’t be able to get them done in time for potential employers to see them anyway. I have a couple projects in various stages of the publication pipeline right now, so I’ll continue working on those, but that won’t be what I spend 100% of my time on.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Well so then I looked at perhaps strengthening the <em>teaching</em> part of my job applications. I’ve been funded through research assistantships this whole time, which has been great! But that means I’ve only had the opportunity to teach twice and I think universities like to see more teaching experience than that. So I thought about getting the <a href="https://grad.uga.edu/degree/cerg-university-teaching/">graduate certificate in University Teaching</a>, which would involve some actual courses in pedagogy. I figure if I couldn’t impress them with experience, maybe I could with training and certification. I’ll admit, it didn’t sound <em>that</em> fun, but some of the courses did look somewhat interesting. However, I found out that I’m ineligible for the certificate anyway because I need to have taught four sections while at UGA to qualify, which I have not. So, I scratched that idea.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">I think I would have taken ones like adult learning, how to do proper assessment, and skills for being able to teach an online course.</span></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>So then I considered getting the graduate certificate in GIS. It’s not totally out of the blue: as a dialectologist, it would be nice to have some actual geography training and it might put me ahead of other potential applicants for positions that wanted a hard-core sociolinguist. The certificate would have been feasible too: I’d take the Intro to GIS course over the summer, and then it would be just two courses in the Fall and two courses in the Spring. In fact, that was what I planned on, and I’m currently taking the Intro to GIS course online right now (and loving it!). But, as I looked through the course offerings, it turns out that the really fun ones that I wanted to take  weren’t going to be offered this year. That means I’d have to take things like working with aerial photography or forestry-related courses or something to satisfy those electives, which wouldn’t be particularly fun or easy.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">I really wanted to do things like spatial statistics, programming in GIS, and cartography.</span></div></div>
<p>All the while, this statistics possibility has always intrigued me. I have always had a knack for quantitative methods in linguistics and feel like I have a better-than-normal grasp of the statistics that linguists use. My undergraduate minor in linguistic computing exposed me to coding, and I’ve learned a lot of R programming since coming to UGA. A lot of the jobs I applied for wanted someone with skills in quantitative linguistics, and while I think I have the skills they want, I had a hard time proving it since my publications so far haven’t been particularly quantitative. I figure an entire <em>degree</em> in statistics might do the trick this time around and would definitely make me stand out. Plus, it’s a nice skill to have to fall back on: it opens doors to college-level teaching opportunities in statistics and to industry jobs as well. So I finally reached out to the statistics graduate coordinator, explained the situation, and he said it would definitely be a possibility.</p>
</section>
<section id="so-whats-the-plan" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-whats-the-plan">So what’s the plan?</h2>
<p>Right away, I had to consider what track I wanted to be on with this degree. The stats department offers a thesis and a non-thesis option for their MS. The non-thesis track has a comprehensive exam at the end and requires two extra elective courses. That sounds great because there are lots of courses I really do want to take. The problem is I just don’t have the time.</p>
<p>My other option was to do the thesis track. There are slightly fewer classes required, which is good for me, but that of course means I’ll have to do a thesis. So I guess I’m writing a master’s thesis in statistics! I don’t know what I’ll write on yet, but it’ll definitely pertain to statistics used in (socio)linguistics, possibly involving some simulations and stuff, but we’ll see. I’m kind of excited about the idea of doing that actually. Plus, it’ll be really weird I think to write a master’s thesis <em>after</em> doing a Ph.D.&nbsp;dissertation.</p>
<p>So I’ve got a busy year ahead of me. After learning as much calculus as I can this summer, I’ll take three courses in the fall, three in the spring, and do some consulting work over the summer while I write my thesis. It should be a blast.</p>

  <title>Simulating Chutes and Ladders</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>
  <link>https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/simulating_chutes_and_ladders/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>We tried teaching our little almost-three-year-old <em>Chutes and Ladders</em> today. She wasn’t very good at counting tiles. But, as I was sitting there climbing up and sliding down over and over, I wondered what the average number of turns it would take to finish the game. So I decided to take a stab at simulating the game. So here’s a post on a simple simulation of <em>Chutes and Ladders</em> that demonstrates absolutely nothing about linguistics and instead shows off some R skills.</p>

<section id="the-game" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-game">The game</h2>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>For those of you deprived people who have never played <em>Chutes and Ladders</em>, the game is quite simple. There are 100 tiles arranged in a 10 by 10 board. With 1–3 of your closest friends, you start at Tile 1, roll a die, and advance that number of tiles. Players take turns moving up the board boustrophedonically. until one person reaches 100. The catch is that there are various “chutes” and “ladders” on the board. If you land on the bottom of one of about half a dozen ladders, you climb to the top, advancing anywhere from 10 to 54 tiles. But, if you land at the top of about a dozen chutes, you slide down anywhere from 4 to 63 tiles. There is no skill and it’s 100% luck—perfect for small kids.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">I’ll admit that half the reason I wrote this post was so I could use this word!</span></div></div>
<p>Here’s a simplified version of the board. First, I’ll read in the data I prepared ahead of time. It just gives the <em>x</em>-<em>y</em> coordinates for each of the 100 tiles.</p>

<p>The game we bought is actually a knock-off (I’m a poor grad student—what do you expect?), but I found an image of the authentic version online so I’ll go with that for this blog post. And for simplicity, I’ll just simulate a one-person game.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-simulation">The simulation</h2>
<p>Simulating the game is relatively straightforward. All you really need is a way to keep track of what tile you’re on, a way to roll the die, and sequence of if-else statements to simulate the chutes and ladders. The die rolling is pretty simple with the help of <code>sample</code>.</p>

<p>Now, in this game, every time you roll a die, you’ll need to advance your token by that many pieces. I could write a separate <code>advance_token</code> function, but with functions this simple, I’ll just combine them into one. This time, it’ll take an argument, <code>spot</code>, which is the current tile number (from 1 to 100) that you’re on. The function takes this spot, rolls a die, and adds that value to it, returning the tile you’ll land on.</p>

<p>Awesome. Now with this, it makes for a pretty uneventful game, so we’ll have to simulate the chutes and ladders. I know base R has <code>switch</code> syntax, but I’ve never been able to get it to work, so I’ll use <code>case_when</code> from the <code>dplyr</code> package to do this. I’ll of course wrap it up in another function verbosely called <code>check_for_chute_or_ladder</code>. Here, I input the start and end points to all the chutes and ladders. So for example, if you land on the very first tile, there’s a ladder that’ll take you to tile 38. If you land on tile 16, you’ll slide down a chute to tile 6. The function will return the new tile you’ll end up on. If you don’t land on any of them, the function will return the same number you sent in.</p>

<p>So as it turns out, these are all the functions I need to simulate an entire game. But, the way it’s set up now, I have to run each turn one at a time, check the output, and run it again. It would be better if I could automate the whole thing and save the results into a dataframe or something.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>So I’ve created the larger <code>simulate_game</code> function below. When I run this function, it’ll simulate an entire (1-player) game. First, it’ll create a mostly empty data frame that will be populated as the turns advance. I know that some programming languages are slow if you try to append rows to a dataframe with each iteration of a loop, so I wanted to make sure there was room for a full game before we do anything else. Also, in theory, the game could last forever because of looping chutes and ladders, so I made it large enough to handle a game with 1000 turns—probably way too many for this, but I wanted to make sure. In that dataframe, I have columns for the turn number, what the dice roll was (those are all predetermined), where you landed, whether it has a chute or a ladder, and finally, where you ended up after traveling on that chute or ladder.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">I think Perl doesn’t care, and I miss that…</span><span class="">I started with 100 turns, but that actually wasn’t enough turns for some of the simulated games!</span></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>I’ve never done a simulation in R before, so I don’t know what the protocol is for looping through something an unknown number of times, so I did this whole <code>while(keep_playing)</code> thing. The <code>keep_playing</code> object is initially true, and at the end of each iteration, I check to see if we’ve gotten to 100; if so, I’ll set that to false, which’ll kill the loop. However, I wanted some sort of iterating number (like in a <code>for</code> loop), so I added <code>i</code> myself.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">I tried just looping through the <code>turn_num</code> column, but I couldn’t get the loop to stop after the player hit tile 100.</span></div></div>
<p>Okay, so then inside that loop, there are several main chunks. Most of it is fluff for handling the data and keeping track of stuff and the actual game portion is just two lines in the middle.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>First, if it’s the first iteration of the loop, set the start tile number to 0. Otherwise, set it to wherever we ended up last time.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, I add the dice roll to to the start tile to get the (potentially) temporary <code>land</code> tile. I then send that number off to <code>check_for_chute_or_ladder</code> and get the actual <code>end</code> tile.</p></li>
<li><p>I then do another conditional to tell whether I had a chute or ladder. In theory, I should just be able to tell that with the <code>check_for_chute_or_ladder</code> function, but I’m not sure how to return two values at once in R like I can with Perl.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, I’ll do one more conditional to see if we’ve reached tile 100. If not, go on to the next iteration of the loop. If so, we’re done.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After the looping is done, we’ve completed a game. Remember that I started by declaring enough space for 1000 turns. I don’t need all the extra rolls, so just before I return the dataframe with all the game information, filter out the rolls that didn’t happen.</p>

<h1>Simulating lots of games</h1>
<p>Okay, so I’ve got the code for simulating a game of <em>Chutes and Ladders</em> and in the example above, I finished a game in just 15 moves. Is that average or did I finish a bit sooner than normal?</p>
<p>To answer this question, I’ll just run the <code>simulate_game</code> function a whole bunch of times and then see if I can see some generalizations. I’ll accomplish this with <code>map</code> from the <code>purrr</code> package.</p>

<p>This <code>games</code> object now contains the data for 1000 games of <em>Chutes and Ladders</em>. It’s nothing more than a bunch of outputs from the <code>simulate_game</code> function all combined into one mega dataframe. It’s got about 36K rows in it, so there’s a lot of information. We can now take this and get some summarized information about each of the games. With <code>summarize</code> I have reduced this down into just one row per game, with information about how many turns the game took, as well as how many chutes and ladders I went through.</p>

<p>Looks like there’s a lot of variation. Game 1 was finished in 68 moves, but Game 2 was done in just 11. Game 4 took a whopping 144 moves! With just plain ol’ <code>summary</code>, I can now just get some information about what an average game was like.</p>

<p>So it appears that it took about 36 turns on average to make it to tile 100. That Game 4 in 16 turns was pretty short—in the top 25%. But now the shortest one took just 7 moves. However, the game theoretically could go on forever, and indeed one game took a whopping 200 turns to finish! I don’t think my two-year-old would appreciate that so much.</p>

<p>So, most of the time, I’ll finish my game in about 15–30 moves. I guess that’s not too bad.</p>
<p>Obviously the most exciting part of the game is getting to travel on some chutes or ladders. How many times did I do that on average? The summary statistics above suggest maybe 3 or 4, but it was also pretty skewed. Let’s look at some visuals.</p>

<p>So it looks like given that there are 10 chutes in this game, I’m probably going to hit about three or four of them. Sometimes it’ll be more though, which would make for an unfortunate game.</p>

<p>Compared to the chutes though the ladders had even more variation. Over 10% of the games didn’t see any of the nine ladders. You’re most likely to hit just one of them, but there were still plenty of games that had as many as 10. I’m not sure why the distribution of chutes and ladders is so different.</p>
<p>So I guess that answered the questions I had. I’m typically going to finish the game in about 20–30 moves, and I’ll have perhaps a half dozen eventful rolls with a chute or a ladder.</p>

<p>I’m just learning how to use gganimate, and it’s pretty cool, so here’s an animation of the longest game. I was curious as to why the one game took 200 moves to finish!</p>

<h1>Most likely tiles</h1>
<p>So of course the next question you might want to ask is what tiles are you most likely to land on. Well it’s not going to be an even distribution because of the chutes and ladders throwing you all over the place. Here’s a simple plot that shows how often the simulation ended a turn on a particular tile.</p>

<p>Now obviously the large spikes are the ends of ladders and chutes, so you’re twice as likely to end up there, either because you took the chute/ladder or because you ended up there by approaching it from a previous tile. But what is interesting to me is the gradual ebb and flow: you’ll spend more time in the 20–50 range and in the 80s, but less time in the 50–70 range. Kinda cool.</p>
<p>Here’s a different way of looking at that data in a way that more closely matches the board.</p>

<h1>Changing the game</h1>
<p>Okay so now the last thing I want to do is explore what happens if you change the game up. If I take away a ladder, how does that affect the game? It probably depends on the length, but let’s try taking out the longest ones and see what happens.</p>
<p>To do this, I’ll create a new version of <code>check_for_chute_and_ladder</code> only the longest ladder is commented out. I’ll then rerun the simulation and compare the results.</p>

<p>So, not surprisingly, if you ignore the longest chute, the games tend to be a little shorter. More games were finished in less than 40 moves and far fewer games took more than about 50 to get finished. And it turns out if you remove the longest ladder, the games are less likely to be shorter and more likely to be longer.</p>

<p>So that’s it. Thanks for joining me on my journey of simulating <em>Chutes and Ladders</em>!</p>

<p>Thursday, <a href="http://faculty.franklin.uga.edu/mrenwick/">Peggy Renwick</a> and I presented our poster on social patterns in static and dynamic measurements of Southern American English vowels. Our dataset was the Digital Archive of Southern Speech (DASS), a collection of 64 interviews from the 1970s. We looked at Pillai scores to measure the degree of “swapping” between pairs of front vowels (/i&nbsp;ɪ/ and /e&nbsp;ɛ/) and we used vector length, trajectory length, and spectral rate of change to see how dynamic the vowels were.</p>
<p>We found a bunch of cool patterns! You can see the poster for all of them, but one of the cooler ones was that /e/ and /ɛ/ swapped more in younger speakers. This plot shows the trajectories of these two vowels split up by generation and you can see how they get closer together (though keep in mind that because the trajectories are drastically different, these aren’t merging).</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/ads-and-lsa-2019/ads2019_EY_EH_gen.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This is to be expected for speakers with the Southern Vowel Shift. But, the African American Vowel Shift doesn’t have this same swapping. So sure enough, if we look at the data split by ethnicity, we see that the African American speakers had less speakers than the European Americans.</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/ads-and-lsa-2019/ads2019_EY_EH_eth.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>So our results are mostly what we expected to find. But this corpus of older recordings give us a unique peek into the past while these changes were developing. And by using both static <em>and</em> dynamic measurements, we can get a more complete picture of what’s going on.</p>

<p>Early Friday morning, I talked about regional patterns in <sc>beg</sc>- and <sc>bag</sc>-raising in North American English. There’s been a lot of research on these phenomena, but only in places like the Upper Midwest, Western Canada, and the Pacific Northwest. Perhaps there is prevelar raising in other areas too?</p>
<p>I used the same dataset that I used for my <a href="../../nwav47">NWAV47</a> presentation: I set up an online survey and asked people how they pronounced several dozen prevelar words. For geographic data, I used GPS coordinates of people’s childhood homes. I ended up with over 500,000 data points!</p>
<p>It was clear that there were differences between the two vowels. <sc>bag</sc>-raising was pretty clear cut: either people had it or they did not. And most people didn’t. There just weren’t too many people that were sort of on the middle ground. However, with and <sc>beg</sc>-raising, while there were lots of people with no raising, there were tons of people with varying amounts of raising. Basically, <sc>beg</sc> was much more variable than <sc>bag</sc>.</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/ads-and-lsa-2019/ads2019_bag_raising_histogram.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/ads-and-lsa-2019/ads2019_beg_raising_histogram.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>And then I showed some plots. The first was <sc>bag</sc>-raising which was reported in pretty much all the areas we expected.</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/ads-and-lsa-2019/ads2019_bag_raising_map.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>But then other map showed that <sc>bag</sc>-raising was pretty much everywhere except for the South. It’s particularly widespread in the West and the Midlands.</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/ads-and-lsa-2019/ads2019_beg_raising_map.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>When you combine the two maps, you can start to see where one occurs without the other. Here, green areas are those that have <sc>bag</sc>-raising but not <sc>beg</sc>-raising and purple are areas with <sc>beg</sc>-raising without <sc>bag</sc>-raising.</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/ads-and-lsa-2019/ads2019_combined_map.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Basically, the purpose of this study was to see whether there were differences between <sc>beg</sc>-raising and <sc>bag</sc>-raising in where they occur regionally. I think these maps show that there are differences. Now I just want to go confirm these patterns with phonetic data!</p>

<p>My last presentation of the weekend was Sunday morning at the American Dialect Society. On behalf of my coauthors, Rachel Olsen, Mike Olsen, Lisa Lipani, and Peggy Renwick, I talked about our research on comparing acoustic data with fieldworker transcriptions in the Digital Archive of Southern Speech. Doing this kind of comparison is not new, and people have found that Linguistic Atlas transcriptions are not really that reliable, but we wanted to look into this for ourselves in our newly transcribed corpus.</p>
<p>So for now, we’re just focusing on the canonical diphthongs /aɪ, aʊ, ɔɪ/ because they’re quite a bit more monophthongal in the South than in other areas. To measure this acoustically, we used trajectory length. For the perception, we looked at the original fieldworker’s protocols they created for each informant, which has example tokens and how those people would pronounce them (in IPA).</p>
<p>Basically there was no correlation between how monophthongal the vowels were acoustically and how they were transcribed. Besides that, in transcriptions the vowels were more monophthongal when they were before /r/, but acoustically they were more monophthongal before /l/ and among European Americans. The two give different results.</p>
<p>So we’ve at least found that whatever the fieldworkers heard when they transcribed these words, it wasn’t trajectory length. Perhaps in the future we can explore some other acoustic measures and see if they correlate better with the transcriptions.</p>

<p>Today, I gave a poster presentation on prevelar raising. As it turns out, despite <sc>beg</sc> and <sc>bag</sc> being relatively small lexical classes, I found phonological, morphological, and lexical effects on the degree of raising, and that the two vowel classes reacted to these influences differently.</p>

<p>So for some speakers, mostly in the Pacific Northwest, the Upper Midwest, and Canada, they raise the <sc>dress</sc> (<sc>beg</sc>) and <sc>trap</sc> (<sc>bag</sc>) vowels before voiced velars. The idea for this research mostly came about because I was trying to figure out whether I have <sc>beg</sc>-raising. Turns out, I do, except for in a few words like <em>integrity</em>, <em>negligible</em>, and <em>segregate</em> which seems somewhat unexpected.</p>
<p>So I set up a categorization task that I distributed via Reddit. I showed people a bunch of <sc>beg</sc> and <sc>bag</sc> words and asked them whether the vowel in their pronunciation is most like that in <em>bake</em>, <em>deck</em>, or <em>back</em>. Almost 7,000 people took the survey and I got over 500,000 observations.</p>
<p>As it turns out, there were clear phonological effects for <sc>beg</sc>. If the /ɡ/ was followed by a sonorant (as in <em>regular</em> or <em>segment</em>), particular a liquid (<em>negligible</em> or <em>segregate</em>), it was indicated to be raised less. Adding suffixes had different effects: people indicated a raised vowel more when <em>-ed</em> was added to verbs, but only for <sc>bag</sc>. There were lexical effects too: for <sc>bag</sc>, more frequent words were raised more, borrowings with <sc>beg</sc> were raised more, and <sc>beg</sc> words with orthographic &lt;ex&gt; (like <em>exile</em> or <em>exit</em>) were virtually never raised.</p>
<p>The takeaway is that even though these are relatively marginal lexical classes, they still have interesting language-internal factors. And, even though <sc>beg</sc>- and <sc>bag</sc>-raising are generally considered to be the same phenomenon of prevelar raising, the two are different. There are some major limitations here, particularly because reported speech is never completely reliable, so I’d like to follow up with an acoustic study. But, I think it’s important to include many more words in a word list because some of these patterns would not have been found if a just small one was used.</p>

  <title>Jealousy List 2</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This is the second post in my occasional series of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/damn-we-wish-wed-done-these-11-stories/">Jealousy Lists</a>. I’m subscribed to about 50 blogs, most of them Data Science–related, and I’ve see a lot of really cool stuff coming out recently. It makes me really want to take my R skills to the next level. Anyway, these are some cool posts that I read recently:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><a href="http://staff.math.su.se/hoehle/">Michael Höhle</a>. <a href="http://staff.math.su.se/hoehle/blog/2018/07/31/circle.html">“Judging Freehand Circle Drawing Competitions”</a>.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed it’s really hard to draw a perfect circle? Apparently, there are people that are really good at it. This post shows how you might determine how perfect the a handdrawn circle is: “We took elements of computer vision, image analysis and total least squares to segment a chalk-drawn circle on a blackboard and provided measures of it’s circularness.” Spoiler alert: the guy’s circle was pretty dang near perfect.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://yihui.name">Yihui Xie</a>. <a href="https://yihui.name/en/2018/08/influence-depth-or-breadth/">“Impact: Depth or Breadth?”</a></p>
<p>In this brief post, Yihui discusses whether we should strive for breadth or depth in our research. He says, “I prefer a small number of people (could even be only one person) feeling extremely excited over a large number of people only slightly nodding.” The logic is that that one person may shout from the rooftops for you, and your impact will spread from there. Also, the one person may just be you. I’ve heard this about app development (make something that <em>you</em> want to use) and it was interesting to see it applied to research too.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://juliasilge.com/about/">Julia Silge</a>. <a href="https://juliasilge.com/blog/evaluating-stm/">“Training, Evaluating, and Interpreting Topic Models”</a>.</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of Julia Silge’s work, and though I’ve never needed to topic modeling in my own research, her blogs (and <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com">book</a>) always make me want to start. In this post, she takes a bunch of texts from the Hacker News Corpus and shows how you might determine the best number of topics to choose when doing topic modeling.

<p>Animations are getting more and more popular, and Pedersen’s <a href="https://gganimate.com">gganimiate</a> package is a great tool for you to create them in R. This post looks at what happens when you try to animate things that are a big different from each other. One type of animation will do so clunkily (like if you want to use Powerpoint to animate transitions between slides…). This post takes a dive at what happens under the hood in ggplot2 and gganimate to help you understand your data and the functions you use.</p></li>

<p>So that’s my jealousy list for now. Image recognition, research, topic modeling, animations, and tables. I’m glad other people put so much interesting stuff online.</p>

<p>Today, I was fortunate to give two presentations on very different areas of my research at the <a href="http://www.linguistics.uga.edu/lcuga-5">5th Annual Linguistics Conference at UGA</a>, one on an obscure consonantal phonological pattern in the West using new recordings and another on well-studied vowel shifts in the South using very old recordings.</p>

</div>
<p>First, I presented on something I’ve noticed in a few speakers, something I call (thr)-flapping. Some people pronounce the /ɹ/ after /θ/ as a flap [ɾ]. In this presentation, I presented some data supporting this hunch.</p>
<p>The articulatory motivations are clear: as the tongue tip moves from between the teeth to a retroflexed position, it may make brief contact with the alveolar ridge. What may have started as an accidental gesture appears to have been phonologized by some speakers.</p>
<p>Looking at phonological factors, in my data (thr)-flapping happened more when the following vowel was non-high and non-front. So it happened more in <em>throb</em>, <em>throng</em>, <em>throne</em>, <em>thrust</em>, and <em>thrive</em> than in <em>thrash</em>, <em>threaten</em>, <em>thread</em>, <em>thrill</em>, <em>three</em> and <em>through</em>. I offer some tentative explanations for this, but without articulatory data, I can’t know for sure.</p>
<p>To my surprise, the social factors I looked at were the opposite of what I expected. Age and sex were not significant, meaning there’s probably not a lot of change in time. But what state people came from (Washington verses Utah—my two fieldsites) <em>was</em> significant. <a href="../../downloads/180108-ads2018-utah.pdf">Utah English has a lot of hyperarticulated consonants</a> and at ADS this year, Di Paolo &amp; Johnson (2018) hypothesize that this has to do with the high proportion of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah. Since public speaking is a common part of their worship services (even as early as the age of 3!), elements of this hyperarticulated register may have spread into other speech styles. (thr)-flapping may be just another manifestation of that. But without attitude or perceptual data, I can’t know for sure.</p>
<p>(thr)-flapping is something I’ve noticed for a while now, and despite the shortcomings of this study, and I was glad to finally present solid evidence that it is a thing!</p>

<p>In the next session, I presented research I been doing with Peggy Renwick on the vowel shifts in the South. The Southern Vowel Shift has front lax vowels raising and front tense vowels lowering, resulting in vowel pairs swapping. Meanwhile, back vowels are fronting. The African American Vowel Shift has the front lax vowels raising, but tense vowels are not lowering, so there wouldn’t be any swapping. Furthermore, back vowels typically aren’t fronted.</p>
<p>We use the Digital Archive of Southern Speech, a corpus of interviews from the 1970s and 1980s. The people in these recordings were born while these shifts were going on, so we can see their development in a way that newer recordings wouldn’t be able to do.</p>
<p>Using Pillai scores and linear mixed-effects models, we find that younger, European American women are leading in the front vowel swapping and that African Americans are participating less in the back vowel fronting. These findings are exactly what we expect, showing that these older recordings confirm what newer ones suggest.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Today, I was asked to do a professionalization workshop on different ways grad students can boost their online presence through building a personal webpage, utilizing social media, and finding their field’s conversation—basically, how to make yourself more googleable. At the end, I challenged people to not leave the room until they had built some sort of new online profile they didn’t have when they walked in.</p>

<section id="social-media" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="social-media">Social Media</h2>
<section id="academia.edu" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="academia.edu"><a href="http://academia.edu">Academia.edu</a></h3>
<p>If you have zero online presence, Academia.edu is a great way to get something up and running quickly. Basically, it’s a freemium social networking site for academics. Users can create profiles, upload their papers, and follow particular research topics. They can also follow others that have done the same. It’s a great resource for finding papers that may be behind a paywall, although it has gotten a lot of criticism for this. Papers you upload can be found by Google Scholar, which is a nice perk. The website will keep track of your analytics, and there’s nothing more thrilling than getting an email saying someone has found your profile!</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/brand-yourself-2/academia_email.png" class="img-fluid" data-fig.width="15em"></p>
<p>There are some negative aspects of Academia.edu. The site got some criticism a few years ago for offering authors the chance to promote their work for a fee. As of about two years ago, they launched a Premium version ($8.25 a month) with extra features and they constantly bug you about it. There’s also a chance at any time the site could get shut down because publishers aren’t happy about it, but with 30 million users, I don’t know if that’s going to happen any time soon. Full disclosure, I deleted my account about a year ago, now that I have this site up and running.</p>
</section>
<section id="researchgate" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="researchgate"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net">ResearchGate</a></h3>
<p>I’m less familiar with ResearchGate, but in my cursory look, there’s a lot of overlap with academia.edu as far as its features. A big difference I noticed is that it seems like it’s more focused on creating networks based on <em>people</em> (folks you you cite and co-author with) while academia.edu is more focused on following <em>topics</em>. Two thing I don’t like about ResearchGate is that the number of emails it sends you is borderline spam and that it’ll create a profile for you based on information that other people put up without you knowing. I think in some fields ResearchGate is more popular than Academia.edu, so it might be worth it to have a profile on both.</p>
</section>
<section id="google-scholar" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="google-scholar"><a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a></h3>
<p>I would imagine most researchers use Google Scholar regularly, but did you know you can create a profile for others to see? You can tell a researcher has done that when you see their name underlined in a search:</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/brand-yourself-2/google_scholar.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In this screenshot (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?lookup=0&amp;q=American+English:+dialects+and+variation&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,11">live link here</a>), you can see that Walt Wolfram, Natalie Schilling, Sali Tagliamonte have created their profiles, but Shanna Poplack and Penny Eckert have not. I’d like to see what else the last two researchers have written, but I can’t simply click on their names like I can with the first three. When you do click on their links, you can see the full profile including what else they have written and how many times each has been cited.</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/brand-yourself-2/natalie_schilling.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>It does take a bit of work to get a full profile going, because Google’s data can be a bit messy, so you’ll have to add stuff in by hand. But I think the payoff is worth the effort.</p>
</section>
<section id="other-academic-social-media" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="other-academic-social-media">Other Academic Social Media</h3>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p> There are a handful of other websites out there that can help you build an online presence. <a href="https://www.impactstory.org">Impact Story</a> is one that can keep track of how much of an impact you have on people by keeping track of when people cite, mention, read you and your work. For $10 a month, it might not be worth it for a grad student, but for a professor applying for tenure this might be worth it.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">I am indebted to the <a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/category/impact-challenge/">Impact Challenge blog series</a>, with the <a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/research-impact-challenge-ebook/">accompanying 200+ page pdf</a>, from which I learned a lot about all this. I would highly recommend that you download it and take a look. Not only does it include much more than what I’ve mentioned here, including step-by-step how-to guides to getting these profiles set up, but also many more topics to get yourself more visible. Thanks, Impact Challenge.</span></div></div>

<section id="what-about-linkedin" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-about-linkedin">What about <a href="https://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a>?</h3>
<p>I haven’t found LinkedIn terribly useful for people looking for academic jobs (like me). It might be worth it to set up a low-maintenance page that gives a good view of you in a nutshell, just in case people look.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="building-a-personal-webpage" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-a-personal-webpage">Building a Personal Webpage</h2>
<p>Keeping track of all these profiles can be tedious. Do you need to update seven different profiles every time you present at a conference? Is it worth it to invest the time in these sites that don’t communicate with each other? One solution is to choose one site to be your main one and build a full profile there. Then, create a “highlights” version on the other social media sites and redirect people to your main page. What should be your main site though? For this reason, it’s nice to have a personal webpage.</p>
<p>The problem with personal webpages it that they come with a cost, either in money or skills (and sometimes both). You can set up a webpage through <a href="https://wordpress.com">Word Press</a>, <a href="http://www.wix.com">Wix.com</a>, or <a href="https://www.squarespace.com">Square Space</a>, which take little technical skill to get a professional page set up. These can be free, but you can get some extra features for $10 a month or more. To me, that’s a pretty penny to pay for a relatively simple webpage.</p>
<p>Another option, which is what <del>I’m doing for</del> [Edit: <em>did</em> for the old version of] this website], is to host the page on <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>. It’s free, but it takes a bit of skill. I’ve had to learn to use Jekyll, Markdown, and CSS, but through some help on <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages">ProgrammingHistorian.com</a> and <a href="https://www.lynda.com">Lynda.com</a>, I was able to get this site up. The benefit of going this route is I have unlimited flexibility in how the site looks, and I really, really like that.</p>
<p>Either way, it’s probably worth it to set up a personal domain name. For as little as $1 a month, you can buy your own domain name (like <span style="white-space: nowrap;">www.joeystanley.com</span>), which looks much more professional than <span style="white-space: nowrap;">www.blogsplot.com/joeystanley</span> or <span style="white-space: nowrap;">www.github.com/joeystanley</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="finding-your-conversation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="finding-your-conversation">Finding Your Conversation</h2>
<p>The last thing we talked about in our workshop is to find where the big names in your field are having their online conversations. This sounds a little weird at first, but every field has some secret space where people are collaborating and sharing ideas informally as well as posting calls for papers, invitations for publications, and job openings. The problem is that where is space is is different for every field.</p>
<p>In some fields, these are a listserv. As far as I know, network analysis and Slavic languages each have a well-known listserv where all the conversation happens. If you’re not on that listserv, you’re out of the loop. Digital Humanities has a space on <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> where over 800 researchers get together and talk. For some fields, it might just be at coffee breaks during certain conferences. You may have to ask around established academics in your field to find that space.</p>
<p>One thing I will mention is that a lot of action happens on Twitter, like livetweeting conferences. I’ve covered this in more depth in <a href="../../blog/the-importance-of-twitter">an earlier blog post</a>, but basically a lot of good stuff can come out of following the right people and seeing just the right tweets.</p>
<div class="sidenote">
<p>I’ve given this presentation multiple times now. You can see the (very similar) <a href="../../downloads/170413-brand-yourself.pdf">slides</a> from April 13, 2017 and the <a href="../../blog/brand-yourself">ones</a> from November 11, 2016.</p>
</div></section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In today’s job market, there’s no surefire way to ensure you’ll get hired. But increasing your online presence and making yourself more googleable probably helps.</p>
