  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>After exactly seven years with my old website, I’ve decided to change it to what you are seeing now.</p>
<section id="what-was-wrong-with-the-old-one" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-was-wrong-with-the-old-one">What was wrong with the old one?</h2>
<p>I built my old website in September 2016. I had a research assistantship at the DigiLab at UGA, and Emily McGinn, the supervisor, suggested I find ways to increase my online presence. I learned some <a href="../../blog/making-a-website-is-fun">web design and CSS skills</a> skills and eventually made Version 1 of my website. That version was essentially the same as what I built in the tutorial I followed, so a few months later I rewrote everything from scratch and made Version 2. (Let’s be honest though, it’s still obviously heavily based on the tutorial.) Other than very minor tweaks to a few things, that’s how my website has been since then.</p>
<p>However, it got a bit unwieldy. The blog was organized just fine, but I also added pages here and there to go along with workshops and other presentations I gave. It got more confusing when I gave the same workshop a second time and had multiple similar pages floating around. Since I didn’t forsee some of these additions, its growth was reminiscent of unplanned suburban sprawl. For examples, sometimes images were just dumped into a folder, others were better organized. Non-blog pages were hidden and were sometimes a top-level page and other times within a dedicated subdirectoy. Each individual addition wasn’t a big deal, but once I stepped back and looked at it all, it was a mess.</p>
<p>The format of my tutorials wasn’t consistent either. I have lots of handouts on my website, tucked away here and there. If they were associated with a workshop, they were separate R Markdown files that didn’t fit in with the rest of the site. Some of my earliest ones are PDFs of Word files!If they weren’t associated with a workshop, they’re regular blog posts. But because the site wasn’t connected to R, I had to do a <em>lot</em> of copying and pasting R Markdown code and careful insertion of images to get those tutorials to look right. In some cases, the extra work made it possible to do things like syntax highlighting in Praat and highlighting specific lines of code. But that was all done by manually inserting HTML tags and updating my CSS.</p>
<p>Also, as careful as I was about my CSS, it wasn’t perfect. I think there were some issues if like a list had only one element, and there were things with hyperlinks. Some one-off portions of blogs or tutorials sometimes didn’t look right. I had a disclaimer at the top of every page, something like, “This website is built from scratch. Pardon the flaws; I am not a web designer.” Which was a humble brag if anything. But as the site grew I didn’t want to change the CSS because it might change some blog post from years ago in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I didn’t mind the mess because it’s what made my site unique. But, what made me finally decide to migrate to Quarto was the underlying architechture. It was built using Jekyll, which involves a programming language called Ruby in some way. After seven years I still have no idea what either of those are. I did this because it’s what the tutorial I followed used. When the site worked, it was great. But sometimes, the Ruby dependencies (called “gems”) would update or break or whatever and I had to google around trying to find a fix. I had no idea what I was doing and it led to a lot of frustrated late nights trying to get my website up and running again.</p>
<p>Then Quarto comes along, which makes it easy to make a blog entirely within R Studio. I have been very familiar with the R world for a while. In 2017, I was an early adopter of <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/">Shiny</a> (at least in linguistics, I think), so I was able to integrate all my html, CSS, and R skills into the <a href="http://lap3.libs.uga.edu/u/jstanley/vowelcharts/">Gazetteer of Southern Vowels</a>. In 2020, I also started dabbling with creating my own R Packages and using the amazing <a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org">pkgdown</a> to make dedicated websites for them (see <a href="https://joeystanley.github.io/joeyr/">joeyr</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JoeyStanley/futurevisions">futurevisions</a>, <a href="https://joeystanley.github.io/barktools/">barktools</a>, and <a href="https://joeystanley.github.io/joeysvowels/">joeysvowels</a>). Finally, I have a side project that involves collecting and analyzing data about what hymns are sung in LDS congregations, and in 2023 I decided to build the <a href="hymnstats.joeystanley.com">site</a> entirely in Quarto.</p>
<p>So, I’ve gradually built up to web development in R over the years and Quarto seems like the logical place to migrate to. Plus, it has some features that I’ve always wanted, like scrolling table of contents and a search feature. After some encouragement from folks on Twitter, I decided it’s time to bite the bullet and go for it.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-does-it-take-to-migrate" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-does-it-take-to-migrate">What does it take to migrate?</h2>
<p>I’m doing this page by page. Here’s the order I took:</p>
<ul>
<li>My homepage and any links on it. I didn’t clean up the linked pages, but at least there weren’t any dead links.</li>
<li>My blogs.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="things-that-are-the-same" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="things-that-are-the-same">Things that are the same</h2>
<p>I’ve tried to keep as much of the original structure of the site the same as I could. However, as I migrate</p>
</section>
<section id="changes" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="changes">Changes</h2>
<p>Here’s a list of the changes I’ve made.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each blog is now in its own self-contained folder. The previous structure had all posts in a single folder and all images in another folder. This time, the images associated with a blog post are contained within that folder. So, instead of this:</p>
<pre><code>├──📁blog
|  ├──📄blog post 1.md
|  ├──📄blog post 2.md
├──📁images
|  ├──🌅image1.png
|  ├──🌅image2.png</code></pre>
<p>It’s now this:</p>
<pre><code>├──📁blog
|  ├──📁blog post 1
|  |  ├──  📄index1.qmd
|  |  ├──  🌅image1.png
|  ├──📁blog post 2
|  |  ├──  📄index.qmd
|  |  ├──  🌅image2.png</code></pre>
<p>It shouldn’t affect any urls to existing blog posts because the url <code>blog/blog post 1</code> in the old format would go to the <code>blog post 1.md</code> file and in the new one it’ll go to the <code>blog post 1</code> directory, which’ll display <code>index.qmd</code> by default. I was concerned about changing the url because I know some people have cited my turorials in published work and I didn’t want those urls to break. I think this’ll work <em>and</em> it’ll keep the site better organized.</p></li>
</ul>

  <title>Kohler Tapes</title>
  <link>https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/kohler-tapes/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>So, I just acquired a goldmine of data that I can use for linguistic analysis. Sitting in my office are 452 cassette tapes, each containing at least 30 minutes of recorded interviews with an older folks from Heber City, Utah. And that’s about half of the collection: the other half is with a historian in Midway, Utah. So, I’m looking at roughly 400–500 hours of audio. Not sure how I’m going to process it all, but I wanted to kick off the beginning of this long-term project with a blog post describing the history of the tapes, why I’m interested in them, and speculations about the future.</p>
<p><img src="https://new.joeystanley.com/images/photos/kohler_tapes.png" width="85%"></p>
<center style="font-size: 75%;">
<p>(452 tapes sitting on my shelf!) <br> <br></p>
</center>
<section id="background" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I first heard about the tapes a little over three years ago. In January 2018, the LSA annual meeting was in Salt Lake City. Wanting to take advantage of the trip out there, I applied for and received a grant from the University of Georgia to collect audio in Heber City, aiming for multiple generations within a family to track language change over time. I decided on Heber partly because it was a region of Utah that had never been the subject of acoustic (let alone linguistic) analysis, as far as I know. My parents were living there at the time too, so they could hook me up with some potential contacts.</p>
<p>So on the morning of the first day of my fieldwork,<span class="sidenote">Side note, it’s amazing that I heard about this goldmine <i>literally</i> through the first person I talked to while doing fieldwork? Who knew that there’d be such an amazing collection of audio sitting in someone’s basement nearby? In fact, there could be lots of collections like these, just collecting dust in people’s basements. All it takes is to find the right person!</span> the first thing I did was go to the Heber Valley Visitor’s Center as a way to potentially find some contacts. Literally the first person I talked to told me about a man who had a huge collection of tapes. One person led me to another, and I was talking to an elderly man named Norm Kohler in his nursing home.</p>
<p>Norm was a beloved middle school teacher in Heber City in the 1980s and 1990s. As a history project, he had each of his students get a cassette tape and interview a grandparent. I don’t know what the interview questions were, but I think they mostly concerned life in Heber Valley. He kept all the tapes his students turned in and, over the course of two decades, he ended up with over 1200 interviews! Norm intended to compile them and put together an oral history of the town, but unfortunately was unable to do so. So, just weeks before I met him, he decided it was best to return the tapes to the family members’ of his students and the people they interviewed. So he put an ad in the paper and hundreds of people claimed their tapes and were able to hear their ancestors’ voices, perhaps for the first time.</p>
<p>However, not all the tapes were claimed. I was told a few hundred remained. So, after Norm passed away a few months later, his family held on to them for a while before finally donating them to the Midway Historical Society. (Midway is the town next door to Heber.) Several complications made it difficult for me to get access to the tapes, including outdated contact information on Midway’s website, the society going on an extended hiatus, me living in Georgia, and then covid. But I did my best to reach out to anyone who might know about where the tapes were being stored.</p>
<p>Finally, on Thursday this week, I was contacted by the historian in custody of the tapes. She asked if I was still interested in them, and I most definitely am! So we had a nice chat about what my goals were for them and what the goals were for the Historical Society, and we think there’s mutual interest in getting them digitized and transcribed. So, the next day, yesterday, she happened to be in Provo so she dropped off about half of the tapes—452 of them!—at my office!</p>
<p>So after three years of following tenuous leads, I finally have the tapes!</p>
</section>
<section id="why-am-i-so-interested" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-am-i-so-interested">Why am I so interested?</h2>
<p>I am a linguist, so why should I care about these tapes? Well, the obvious reason is that it’s a <em>lot</em> of audio. For my dissertation I analyzed about 40 hours of interviews and that was already a lot of data. This is at least 10 times the amount of audio. In fact, it’s about the size of the <em>Digital Archive of Southern Speech</em>, a subset of the <em>Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States</em>, that I spent four years in grad school analyzing. So having access to this much audio is absolutely incredible</p>
<p>But it’s not just the amount of audio. There are dozens of oral history projects even in Utah. This particular set is attractive for several reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The nature of the homework assignment ensured good metadata. A few tapes have already been digitized and they all start off introducing the interviewer (the middle-schooler) and the interviewee, with information like the date of interview, their age, and where they grew up.</p></li>
<li><p>Because these were all students in the same smallish town in Utah<span class="sidenote">There were about 4500 people living in Heber in the 1980s and 1990s, which means this sample represents like a significant chunk of the community!</span> the sample will be relatively homogeneous geographically. While it doesn’t ensure that the interviewees (the grandparents) were from Heber or Heber Valley generally, my guess is that a significant number of them are.</p></li>
<li><p>Typically, interviews happen with a historian or someone that the interviewer is unfamiliar with. In sociolinguistics, it’s generally accepted that the degree of familiarity with the interviewer can have an influence on a person’s speech. In all cases with these tapes, the interviewer is a teenager and a grandchild of the interviewee. So that lowers the formality of the situation and will likely mean that the interviewees’ speech will be more casual.</p></li>
<li><p>Heber Valley has been the focus of very little acoustic research. There may be occasional interviews as parts of the Linguistic Atlas Project or the <em>Dictionary of Regional American English</em>, but no study, as far as I know, has focused on Heber. Instead, most research looks at people from Utah Valley and Salt Lake Valley. This collection of interviews will offer a new spot on the map of Utah dialectology and a nice point of comparison between more urban and more rural areas of the state.</p></li>
<li><p>I have virtually no metadata about the interviewees right now, but if their grandchildren were about 14 years old in the 1980s and 1990s, then the speakers in these tapes were born perhaps sometime between 1900 and 1940. There has been some research on the development of Utah English, mostly by David Bowie, but he acknowledges that it was based on public sermons given by upper-class white men. This collection offers a unique look into how other Utahns born around that time talked. And since I have some comparable data from contemporary Heber City residents, I can begin to look at language change in real time.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So there are lots of reasons for why I’m really interested in this collection of tapes. And that’s on top of the oral history the Midway Historical Society wants to create based on them.</p>
</section>
<section id="looking-ahead" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>Luckily, I’ve had some experience working on a project of this size. For four years at the University of Georgia, I was a part of the team that processed the <a href="http://www.lap.uga.edu/Site/DASS.html"><em>Digital Archive of Southern Speech</em></a>, which is a 367-hour subset of the <em>Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States</em>. So I’ve sat in on transcriber training sessions, seen what kinds of obstacles get in the way of processing, managed thousands of files, and analyzed spreadsheets with a couple million acoustic measurements in them. However, that was only as a graduate student. I’m sure there’s a lot that goes on behind the scenes as a PI that I didn’t see.</p>
<p><em>Transcribers</em>—Some back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that I’ll need a sizable grant to get this all processed. Again, I don’t have definite numbers for anything, I know my 452 tapes are a little over half of them, so let’s say there are 700 tapes total. They’re all at least 30 minutes long and I know many went longer, so if I average say 40 minutes per tape, that’s 28,000 minutes or roughly 467 hours. I think the the transcribers for <em>DASS</em> averaged about 13 hours per 50 minutes of audio or so, but this audio is newer and I presume Utah transcribers will be more familiar with Utah speakers I think, so I’ll estimate 10 hours of work per tape. That’s 4670 hours of transcription. At $15 per hour, I’m looking at about $70,000 in student wages. Obviously, I can’t get that much coin internally so it sounds like this is only going to happen with an external grant.</p>
<p><em>Grad student workers</em>—That’s of course assuming that the only wages I’ll need to pay for are transcribers. This might be getting into “If you give a mouse a cookie” territory, but it would be nice to have some grad students helping out with the project. At UGA, we had at least four and as many as six grad students involved in the project at a time. There was a lot of overlap between our duties, but very roughly speaking, one managed the transcribers, one managed the spot-checks, one managed the acoustic analysis, and one did miscellaneous duties. We were all involved in analysis, and a few others popped in for a semester or two to do additional analysis or perform other duties. To lighten my load, it would be handy to have perhaps three grad students manage the transcribers, check their work, and do the acoustic analysis. I’m fuzzy on what costs are associated with RA-ships at BYU, but I do know it’ll add significantly to the total cost of the project.</p>
<p><em>Time</em>—How long will transcriptions take? I’ve done transcriptions and they’re soul-sucking work. Even when I was highly motivated to process my own dissertation data, that I collected myself, and under a bit of a time crunch, I could barely put in more than about two hours a day. I surely don’t expect undergraduate transcribers to do more than 10 hours a week. When motivated by money, I’ve seen some at UGA do more, but those students were exceptional. I’ll estimate five hours of work per transcriber per week. So under the assumption of 4670 hours of work total, that’s 934 transcriber-weeks. If a semester is fifteen weeks, that’s 62 transcriber-semesters. If I set a goal of getting all the work done in two years (six semesters if you include summers), it would take ten or eleven transcribers to do it in two years. Of course, these are all very rough estimates, but managing several tens of thousands of dollars and almost a dozen workers for two years is not something I expected to do right away!</p>
<p><em>Digitizing</em>—Regardless of the cost, number of workers, and time involved, the first step of the process will be digitization. Fortunately, it sounds like the Office of Digital Humanities can take care of that for me! Wow! So my short term goal is to get a batch—maybe 30 or 50 tapes—done first. While they work on digitizing the next batch, I can get started on listening to the first few minutes of the completed tapes and extracting whatever metadata I can from them. Eventually, all the tapes will be digitized and I can have a more concrete idea of how much audio (and consequently, people, time, hours, and money) I’m looking at.</p>
<p><em>Metadata</em>—After digitizing all of them, my next step will be to finish collecting the metadata. It’ll be nice to have a clear picture of birth years, genders, and birthplaces for all 700 or so people. The most likely scenario is that I <em>won’t</em> get an external grant because they’re extremely competitive, so I’ll have to prioritize which ones to transcribe first. The Historical Society would like to start with some of the prominent members of the community and descendants of the town’s founders. I’d like to find a balance of genders and birth years too, so we’ll probably settle on a subset that satisfies both of our needs. How big? I’m thinking between 35 and 70 (5% to 10% of the tapes). That’s a more reasonably-sized project that I could possibly get funded internally. It could provide me at least a beginning look at the speech community which would help seed an external grant.</p>
<p><em>Follow-up project?</em>—In case I just need more data to analyze (ha!) wouldn’t it be cool to track down some of the tapes that were given away? Presumably, if an ad in the paper is what it took for the families to get them, then an ad might be a good place to start to find them. We’d digitize the tapes right there for people, give them a copy and return the tape to them of course, but then also add that to the collection for the oral history. I think it would be especially cool to interview those people themselves! That way we can get some contemporary data to compare the tapes to, as well as track change within the family. That’ll have to wait until I get NSF grant number two!</p>
<p><em>Publications</em>—What’s the end goal? Well, I’ll obviously start cranking out some papers as soon as a reasonable amount of data has been processed. There is a <em>lot</em> going on in Utah English. Many of the stereotyped features are dying out, so these people may provide good acoustic data for what would otherwise be hard to study phonetically today. But there are also lots of other features that I believe are recent innovations, so if they’re infrequent or missing from these speakers, it’ll help establish the timing of when they did develop. Even before I had the tapes, I’ve been thinking a full analysis of this collection deserves a book-length treatment. It likely won’t get done before I’m up for tenure, but maybe it’ll go towards my application for full professor.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The history of the Kohler Tapes is pretty cool, and I’m lucky to be a part of the creation of an oral history of Heber City. It’s so satisfying teaming up with a historical society and finding ways to help the community I’m studying too. Linguistically, they’re interesting to me for lots of reasons, but I think everyone benefits from seeing these tapes get processed. As far as how I’m going to go about processing all of them, I really have no idea what I’m doing so there will be a lot of learning involved. But I’m excited to be involved and to have a clear research trajectory for the next decade or so!</p>

  <title>The Importance of Twitter</title>

  <link>https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/the-importance-of-twitter/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I’m preparing a workshop right now for the DigiLab here at UGA on how to increase your web presence. I’ll give a more detailed explanation of that later on, but I just wanted to point how how cool Twitter has been for me.</p>
<p>I don’t remember when or why I got a Twitter account, but I remember early on that I wanted to keep it professional. I don’t follow very many friends or family: just other random linguists I find. That means my feed is nothing but linguistics stuff, and mini posts that other linguists find interesting. Granted, a lot of these folks post non-linguistic stuff as well, so I do have to sift through those sometimes. But there have been some really valuable gems I’ve found because of Twitter.</p>
<section id="fun-stuff" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fun-stuff">Fun Stuff</h2>
<p>First, we’ll start with the fun stuff.</p>

<p>This didn’t lead to anything in my work, but it was pretty awesome to see what Jack Grieve had done. In case the link doesn’t load above, it shows an interactive program where you can type in a word and see its regional distribution across Twitter. It’s a lot of fun to play around with.</p>

<p>Twitter has also been good for me to discover new datasets. This tweet for example let me know that the entire contents of Reddit had been extracted and were available for download.</p>

</blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>About a month or so later I was starting a course in Digital Humanties, so this corpus became the main tool for my term paper for that class. I ended up downloading all the Reddit comments from its inception (2007) until October 2015. It was a whopping 50 <em>billion</em> words of text sitting on a terabyte of storage. If this were printed on standard book-sized sheets of paper, it would be something like 2½ miles long! And growing at about 4 feet an hour. That’s a lot of data. I don’t have a terabyte of storage available for something like this, so I wrote a Perl script that cut it down to a hundredth of its original size (“only” 500 million words!).</p>
<p>I ended up having to download it all using lab computers in the student center off and on for a week. In fact, I had four computers going simultaneously, all downloading Reddit files, one month at a time, and running Perl scripts to make them smaller. I wasn’t surprised when IT came over and wondered what the heck I was doing. Turns out it was the fact that my login was used on four computers that triggered their systems, not the fact that I was running four computers at full speed for a couple hours. Once they saw what I was doing they shrugged their shoulders and said it was totally fine.</p>
<p>Handling this much data, even though it was a hundredth of the original size, was rough. I made a frequency list of all the words, which ended up being about half a million rows long. I wanted to track language across time so I had information about how often each word was used every month for about 100 months. That’s a lot of columns for all those rows. I pushed Excel (and my little laptop) to its limits.</p>
<p>Anyway, this project turned into a fun term paper that I never published. I wanted to look at the language of the most upvoted comments as compared to all other comments and see if there were any differences. I found a few, but with biggish data like this, statistical significance is everywhere so you have to be more careful about things.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Because of Twitter I got to work with an enormous corpus which was a lot of fun.</p>

<p>On Twitter people also post new things they see at conferences and other places. During NWAV44, I followed the live tweets and saw this gem:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote" data-lang="en">

</blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>Basically, Daniel Johnson talked about another way to measure vowel overlap—something I do a lot in my research. In the Shiny App linked above, Johnson compares Pillai scores and something called Bhattacharyya affinity. I ended up using this in a <a href="../../downloads/160714-LabPhon15-poster.pdf">poster</a> (abstract <a href="../../downloads/160714-LabPhon15-abstract.pdf">here</a>) I did with <a href="http://faculty.franklin.uga.edu/mrenwick/">Peggy Renwick</a> at <a href="http://labphon.org/labphon15/program">LabPhon</a>, and will continue to use this new measure of overlap, not exclusively, but in addition to the other measures out there.</p>

<section id="live-tweeting-conferences" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="live-tweeting-conferences">Live Tweeting Conferences</h2>
<p>I’m a lowly grad student and don’t have a ton of funding for conferences, so I can’t attend some of the big ones all the time. Luckily, a lot of people live tweet what’s going on at most major conferences, so I can follow along and feel like a part of the group.</p>
<p>I myself live tweeted for the first time at a linguistics conference here at UGA. I don’t have a ton of followers, and the conference isn’t super well-known. But I did try to find people’s Twitter handles whenever possible, as well as their department’s, and would include them in the tweets. Well as it turns out I got about half a dozen new followers from that conference. Not a huge deal, but it does spread my name just a little bit further, and maybe onto the right person’s computer screen.</p>

<section id="twitter-is-great" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="twitter-is-great">Twitter is great</h2>
<p>So in the end, having a Twitter account is a lot of fun. I’ve benefitted personally and professionally, and it’s definitely a worthy investment of my time.</p>

  <title>Making a website is fun!</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>
  <link>https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/making-a-website-is-fun/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>In the past month or so I’ve been putting a lot of time and effort into increasing my professional web presence. In about a year I’ll be applying for academic positions, and it would sure be nice to be more visible to my potential employers. The sheer fact that you’re reading this means you’ve seen some of the fruits of my labor.</p>
<section id="why-now" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-now">Why now?</h2>
<p>It took me a while before I wanted to find out what area of linguistics I wanted to go into. I’ve been interested in a lot of things at one time or another: typology, documentation, indigenous languages of South America, language change, simulation, morphology, network analysis, forms of address, among other things. I’ve even gone to conferences presenting some of this research. But I knew at the time that whatever it was that I was presenting on wasn’t going to be what I wanted to be known for. So I didn’t bother networking with other people, and I hardly took people’s advice because I would brush this off and say it was just a glorified term paper.</p>
<p>But I’ve found my niche. I’m interested in sociolinguistics, dialectology, phonetics, phonology, and using computer and statistics to help me out. This is something I’d like to be known for. Right now I’m working on English in the Pacific Northwest, and I’m familiar with a lot of the work that’s been done in that area, so I know who to talk to at conferences because I’ve read a lot of their work.</p>
</section>
<section id="github" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="github">Github</h2>
<p>Over the past five years or so in my undergrad and graduate education, I’ve acquired some computer skills. I minored in linguistic computing, so I learned Perl and C# as a part of the required coursework. More importantly though, I learned that learning to use computers is pretty darn useful for my research. So I’ve learned a few other skills along the way to help me out with my larger linguistics questions.</p>
<p>Just this month I presented a paper on Quechua morphology. I mentioned in it that I wrote a computer script to help me out with generating the correct forms of the paradigm. One of the commenters in the Q&amp;A session asked if the code was available on Github and I said it wasn’t. But why shouldn’t it be? That acted as a catalyst into getting a github profile and uploading some code. I also found out I could host a webpage (this webpage!) on there too. Well sweet.</p>
</section>
<section id="creating-the-webpage" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="creating-the-webpage">Creating the webpage</h2>
<p>Having never done web design before, I had a lot to learn. Turns out you’ve gotta host the webpage somewhere. By that I mean that all the files and formatting and content and stuff in a webpage has to be stored on some computer somewhere. It can’t be mine, because I’ve set it up as a server and stuff and that’s way beyond me expertise—plus I’m pretty sure I don’t want to have my laptop as a web server. So luckily, Github, will host mine for free. Okay good.</p>
<p>The next task was to figure out how. I had recently heard about a website called <a href="http://programminghistorian.org">The Programming Historian</a>, which has a lot of slick, easy-to-follow tutorials on how to do useful computer stuff for research. Well, one of their pages is called “<a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages">Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages</a>”. Awesome. Now, to be clear, it wasn’t the easiest tutorial. You have to download all sorts of stuff to your computer using the command line and manage a bunch of files and stuff. But that’s fine. I got it. I was able to create a simple webpage.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Well, I’m never really satisfied with the default design of things, and I like having unlimited flexibility in how things look. So, I went over to <a href="http://lynda.com">Lynda.com</a>, which I have access to through UGA, and took a more detailed course on how to build a webpage using Jekyll. And it was great. I learned a lot and figured out what a lot of stuff means.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">Edit: Looks like the “Jekyll Web Design” course is no longer available. Makes sense; it was from 2016!</span></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>But, I’m still not satisfied with the way it looks. I learned how the website works in that course, but not a lot of formatting. So I’m currently taking another Lynda.com , which I think will help me a lot. As it turns out, the concepts are very similar to the job I did as an undergrad, where I essentially created eBooks for a program called <a href="http://wordcruncher.com">WordCruncher</a>.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">Looks like this one is missing too. It was called CSS Core Concepts. I wish I knew who the instructor was.</span></div></div>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>My goal in all this is to be able to make a beautiful webpage that is uniquely mine. I want all the flexibility I could ever want in how it works and looks. By so doing, I’m learning a lot of new skills like CSS, but that’s perfectly okay with me. So, today the webpage is still a hack off of the tutorial I went through, but hopefully over the course of the next few weeks and months it’ll slowly transform into my own.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><span class="">Now that I’ve switched to Quarto, I’ve lost much of that uniqueness and flexibility.</span></div></div>
<p>I guess the end goal of this is to wow potential employers still. But, let’s be honest, I’m sure enjoying the journey.</p>

  <title>Reviewer Feedback</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>
  <link>https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/reviewer-feedback/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Yesterday I got the reviewer feedback for the <a href="../../blog/ads-meeting">paper I’m going to be presenting</a> at the American Dialect Society in January.</p>
<p>This is not the first time I’ve gotten reviewer feedback: I’ve submitted several things to big enough conferences where reviewers give their feedback. But they’re usually something like, “Okay yeah that’s cool and all, but here are some obvious things you should consider. I’ll reluctantly give you a pass, but I expect major changes at the conference.” Either that, or they’re brutally honest and say it’s garbage.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the feedback every time because it’s completely spot-on, and reading an uncomfortable email alone at my desk is merciful compared to what I might potentially hear at conferences. Or worse, what I might <em>not</em> hear but what people think.</p>
<p>But, I’m happy to report I had three glowing reviews this time! On top of that, I was offered advice on some studies to look up and some ways to strengthen my argument. Maybe this <em>is</em> an interesting topic after all!</p>

  <title>JMP</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>
  <link>https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/jmp/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>As a part of my assistantship this year, I get to work with the DigiLab in the Main Library at UGA. It’s a fun little gig where I get to do presentations, workshops, and seminars on digital humanities, in addition to helping researchers one-on-one on their own projects.</p>
<p>I’ve always been fairly tech savvy in my research. I minored in Linguistic Computing and had a job as an undergrad creating eBooks. I’ve always been fairly quantitative about things too, and I went over to the stats department last year and took classes on linear regression and multivariate analysis.</p>
<p>This week is my first presentation where I’ll show how to extract data from primary sources, introduce people to spreadsheets, and showcase <a href="https://www.jmp.com/en_us/home.html">JMP</a> If you’ve never heard of it, JMP (pronounced “jump”) is a pretty sophisticated piece of statistical software that can do all sorts of statistical analyses and visualizations. The great part is it’s drag-and-drop interface. No coding means it’s great for beginners.</p>
<p>I’ll be the first to admit that JMPs visualizations (at least as well as I can make them) are not as good as what I can do with ggplot2 in R. But I do like how easy it is to make quick and dirty visualizations in JMP. For this reason, it’s usually my go-to when exploring a new dataset. With just a few clicks, it makes it really easy to get to know your data visually as well as what’s under the hood.</p>
<p>As far as I know, JMP is not widely used in Linguistics or even in the Humanities, so showcasing it will be a lot of fun to people this week. I still think that everyone should learn R for their research, but since coding can be intimidating, JMP is a great tool for researchers wanting to get more quantitative about their projects.</p>
<p>Update (October 7): I just finished the presentation. I had about a dozen people in attendance, and I was the youngest person in the room. And besides the one other grad student there, I was probably the only one without a Ph.D.&nbsp;But, I feel like it went well. Not to mention, it was the first time I was introduced before a presentation, <em>and</em> there was food!</p>

  <title>The Linguistic Atlas of the Pacific Northwest</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>
  <link>https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/linguistic-atlas-of-the-pacific-northwest/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>As a part of my research assistantship this year, I work with the <a href="http://lap.uga.edu">Linguistic Atlas Project</a>, under the direction of Dr.&nbsp;William Kretzschmar. It’s an exciting project to be a part of.</p>
<p>There is a lot going on in the lab right now. We’ve got a team of over a dozen undergrad transcribers working dutifully on an NSF grant awarded to Kretzschmar and Dr.&nbsp;Peggy Renwick, not to mention the web developers for the Atlas Project and for Complex Systems.</p>
<p>One of the things I’m excited about is that I now have access to all the data for the Atlas Projects from over half a century ago. In a nutshell, what happened is that in the 30s and through the 50s and 60s, Hans Kurath and a team of researchers set out to document the language geography of the United States and Canada. Armed with whatever recording devices they could afford, several hours’ worth of interview questions, and expert phonetic transcribers, they set out to document all the accents and dialects of English in North America.</p>
<p>They were partially successful. Starting in New England and in the East, they talked to a couple thousand people, painstakingly analyzed the data, and published a couple multi-volume works specifically focused on certain areas of the United States. Thus, we have the Linguistic Atlases of New England (LANE), the Gulf States (LAGS), and the Upper Midwest (LAUM). However, funding was cut short. Realizing they may have bitten off more than they can chew, the data collected in other portions of the country was never published, other than some brief overviews by some of the researchers. Time passed, and for one reason or another, the majority of this unpublished data disappeared into obscurity.</p>
<p>By the late 1970s and into the 1980s, the original handwritten field notes and any extant recordings were scattered across multiple locations. The original researchers’ dream to publish this data for a general audience was never fulfilled, let alone the majority of potential publications for a more specialized audience. The data was always supposed to be accessible to anyone interested, and just a few decades later it was collecting dust in basements, accessible to probably the half a dozen people that knew about it.</p>
<p>In 1983 some of the data was under threat of being thrown out. Luckily, William Kretzschmar offered to take all the data from all projects and house it at the University of Georgia. Since then, he has been in the process of realizing the original researchers’ dream of making the data accessible. In the 21st century, that means digitizing it all and putting it online. And there has been success in that endeavor.</p>
<p>This is where I come in. As a lowly out-of-state grad student, I’m not particularly concerned with language around Georgia, as interesting as it is. I do however like research on the opposite side of the country: the Pacific Northwest. Only after reading about the <em>Linguistic Atlas of the Pacific Northwest</em> (LAPNW) did I realize that all that data was being housed by my own university. So as soon as I was offered the assistantship in the Linguistic Atlas office, I expressed interest in the LAPNW data. Well, just today, I made a visit to the repository where all the data is held.</p>
<p>After sitting alone for half an hour on the concrete floor literally in the furthest corner in that warehouse, I was quickly able to assess the situation. From what I’ve been able to tell, there are just four boxes of LAPNW data. Compared to the dozens of boxes in the large-scale projects (LANE, LAGS, etc.), it’s a meager project. One box contains the original handwritten notes for about half of the 51 participants, which is great, but I’m a little sad that some of the originals have been lost. But the other three boxes were all copies, including a complete set for all participants and another partial set. I don’t know who did the photocopies or when they were done, but I’m really glad we have them.</p>
<p>So, I brought them back to the office and I’ve started to look through them. It’s a bit exciting for me actually. Since being housed at UGA, I don’t know if these boxes have been opened by <em>anyone</em>. As far as I know, there are probably ten people in the world that would be interested in the LAPNW data, and certainly none of them have had the ability to peruse UGA’s repository. So this stuff literally hasn’t seen the light of day for decades. I don’t know what I’m going to do with this goldmine, but I’d sure like to revive it somehow and possibly do what I can to make it accessible. It’s an exciting time for me.</p>

  <title>ADS Meeting!</title>
  <dc:creator>Joey Stanley</dc:creator>
  <link>https://new.joeystanley.com/blog/ads-meeting/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I’m thrilled to announce I’ve been accepted to present a paper at the 2017 annual conference of the American Dialect Society!</p>
<p>When I was an undergrad I was a part of a research team that presented at the LSA Annual Meeting in Boston in 2013. (I actually cut my honeymoon short so I could attend that meeting!) I was a starry-eyed budding little linguist with no real idea of what was going on. However, I do remember spending a large chunk of my time at that conference in the ADS presentations. In fact I still talk about some of the presentations I saw there.</p>
<p>Two years later, the LSA and its sister societies met in Portland. Being a short drive from where my wife grew up, we decided to fly out so she could see her family and so I could attend the conference. Again, I found myself almost exclusively attending the ADS meetings. (Part of that may have been that it was up on like the 23rd floor and the room had a fantastic view!) I recognized people from the Boston meeting (Tyler Kendall, Sali Tagliamonte, etc.) and was also able to put some faces to names I had read (Charles Boberg, David Bowie, etc.). As it turns out, there were several presentations on language in the West that I ended up citing in some of my own work.</p>
<p>Now, two years later, I’m extremely happy to be presenting at the 2017 meeting. Now that I have a clear idea about what my research interests are, and I know many more scholars’ works besides recognizing their name, I hope to reach out and talk with many of these people. Hopefully I’ll come across less of a fan and more as a colleague.</p>
<p>I get to present a portion of my data that I collected in Washington just a few months ago. In a nutshell I’m showing that in word lists people pronounce <em>pull</em> and <em>pole</em> the same but <em>Mary</em> and <em>merry</em> different, but in a minimal pair task, <em>pull</em> and <em>pole</em> are separate while <em>Mary</em> and <em>merry</em> are the same.</p>
<p>I’m about to give two completely unrelated presentations soon, so my focus hasn’t been on this Pacific Northwest, but once that wave has passed I’ll be able to devote more time and energy into this. It’s a very exciting time for me and I really look forward to the conference.</p>
