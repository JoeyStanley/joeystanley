The function overlays text over curved lines, giving you the possibility to add nice labels to the data. \n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#rstats</a> ggplot2 geom is really nice <a href=\"https://t.co/URYoZEW8uc\">https://t.co/URYoZEW8uc</a>.

In 2023 when I transferred to my new website, I reran it with a later version and some of the code broke. I've update the code now, but please be aware that the prose, which is based on the earlier version, may not match the plots, which are created with the latest release.\n:::\n\n\n## Data prep\n\nI'll use some trajectory data I have in my [`joeysvowels`](https://joeystanley.github.io/joeysvowels/) package. I'll mostly work with data from the `coronals` object. This contains a bunch of formant trajectory data from me reading all my vowels flanked by a bunch of combinations of coronal consonants (they were mostly nonce words like /sneɪz/, /nɔdz/, and /dʊz/). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncoronals\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 14,446 × 13\n   vowel_id start   end     t percent    F1    F2    F3    F4 word  pre   vowel\n      <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr> <chr> <fct>\n 1        1  2.06  2.41  2.06       0  387. 1701. 2629. 3164. snoʊz sn    GOAT \n 2        1  2.06  2.41  2.07       5  483. 1591. 2454. 3310. snoʊz sn    GOAT \n 3        1  2.06  2.41  2.09      10  525. 1466. 2526. 3343. snoʊz sn    GOAT \n 4        1  2.06  2.41  2.13      20  530. 1297  2616. 3330  snoʊz sn    GOAT \n 5        1  2.06  2.41  2.14      25  497. 1223. 2562. 3280. snoʊz sn    GOAT \n 6        1  2.06  2.41  2.16      30  461. 1172. 2559. 3252  snoʊz sn    GOAT \n 7        1  2.06  2.41  2.18      35  414. 1120  2625. 3247. snoʊz sn    GOAT \n 8        1  2.06  2.41  2.20      40  423  1072. 2655. 3175. snoʊz sn    GOAT \n 9        1  2.06  2.41  2.22      45  396. 1074  2623. 3248. snoʊz sn    GOAT \n10        1  2.06  2.41  2.23      50  368. 1018. 2602. 3168. snoʊz sn    GOAT \n# ℹ 14,436 more rows\n# ℹ 1 more variable: fol <chr>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere's a lot of data and I don't need to plot all trajectories of all observations, so I'll boil them down to one trajectory per vowel by taking the median per timepoint per vowel.

Here's what it looks like with the function in its most basic form.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(avg_trajs, aes(F2, F1, color = vowel)) +\n  geom_textpath(aes(label = vowel), arrow = my_arrow) + \n  scale_x_reverse() +\n  scale_y_reverse() + \n  theme_joey() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo, a few things to note here. The behavior of the function is most easily seen in <sc>goose</sc> and <sc>choice</sc>. It chooses a spot in the middle of the line and overlays the label. The line itself is cut into two pieces (a behavior that can be overriden with `cut_path = FALSE` if I wanted) with the label centered in the gap. Overall, I'm not a huge fan of the out-of-the-box look, but we can adjust things to make it look better.\n\nOne main problem with this look is that the lines go through the label, which isn't great. We can adjust the vertical position of the label with the `vjust` argument, which will position it slightly above the line. While we're adjusting the position of the label, I'll set `hjust` to `0`, which will move it to the onset of the vowel.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(avg_trajs, aes(F2, F1, color = vowel)) +\n  geom_textpath(aes(label = vowel),\n                hjust = 0,\n                vjust = -0.25,\n                arrow = my_arrow) +\n  scale_x_reverse() +\n  scale_y_reverse() + \n  theme_joey() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor some vowels, this looks pretty well. However, because of the jaggedness of the lines, the label itself is going to be pretty jagged. Lines like <sc>mouth</sc>, <sc>price</sc>, and <sc>fleece</sc> are illegible. \n\n<!--There is a `geom_textsmooth` which is the `geomtextpath` equivalent of `stat_smooth`, which might be good, except like `stat_smooth` it only fits a smoothed line from left to right, and most of these trajectories double back on themselves and don't quite work.-->\n\nFortunately, the argument `straight`, when set to `TRUE`, will force the text to be straight. According to the documentation, it is helpful for \"noisy paths\", which I think perfectly applies to our this data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(avg_trajs, aes(F2, F1, color = vowel)) +\n  geom_textpath(aes(label = vowel),\n                hjust = 0,\n                vjust = -0.25,\n                arrow = my_arrow,\n                straight = TRUE) +\n  scale_x_reverse() +\n  scale_y_reverse() + \n  theme_joey() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is better, but I'm not a fan of how some of them cross the lines themselves (like <sc>thought</sc>, <sc>fleece</sc>, <sc>choice</sc>). \n\nA potential solution I came up with is to fit a GAM to the data. Here's some quick and dirty code that fits GAMs to both F1 and F2 for each vowel, extracts predicted measurements, and plots them instead. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(mgcv)\nlibrary(itsadug)\n\ncoronals_gam_preds <- coronals %>%\n  # Subset the data\n  filter(percent >= 10, percent <= 60) %>%\n  select(vowel, percent, F1, F2) %>%\n  # Add an id column\n  rowid_to_column() %>%\n  # Reshape it to a \"long\" formant\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(F1, F2), names_to = \"formant\", values_to = \"hz\") %>%\n  # Group for the GAMs\n  group_by(vowel, formant) %>%\n  nest() %>%\n  # Fit the GAM and extract predicted measurements\n  mutate(mdl = map(data, ~bam(hz ~ percent + s(percent), data = .)),\n         preds = map(mdl, ~get_predictions(., cond = list(percent = 10:60), print.summary = FALSE))) %>%\n  # Post-processing\n  select(-data, -mdl) %>%\n  unnest(preds) %>%\n  rename(hz = fit) %>%\n  select(-CI) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = formant, values_from = hz) %>%\n  print()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 663 × 4\n# Groups:   vowel [13]\n   vowel percent    F1    F2\n   <fct>   <int> <dbl> <dbl>\n 1 GOAT       10  449. 1232.\n 2 GOAT       11  447. 1218.\n 3 GOAT       12  445. 1204.\n 4 GOAT       13  444. 1189.\n 5 GOAT       14  442. 1176.\n 6 GOAT       15  440. 1162.\n 7 GOAT       16  438. 1149.\n 8 GOAT       17  436. 1136.\n 9 GOAT       18  434. 1123.\n10 GOAT       19  432. 1111.\n# ℹ 653 more rows\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(coronals_gam_preds, aes(F2, F1, color = vowel)) +\n  geom_textpath(aes(label = vowel),\n                vjust = -0.5,\n                hjust = 0,\n                arrow = my_arrow,\n                straight = TRUE) +\n  scale_x_reverse() +\n  scale_y_reverse() + \n  theme_joey() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe results show a smoother line and indeed smoother labels, but there are still some positions I'm not a fan of, like <sc>kit</sc>, <sc>choice</sc>, and <sc>thought</sc>.\n\nOverall, I'm haven't *quite* found a plot that I'm satisfied with. Perhaps with a different dataset it could work, but at least for this one, this F1-F2 plot isn't quite doing what I was hoping.\n\n\n\n## Spectrogram plots\n\nAnother potential use for `geomtextpath` is to create spectrogram-like plots. Here's a simple one with all the vowels plotted, split up by formant.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\navg_trajs %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(F1, F2), names_to = \"formant\", values_to = \"hz\") %>%\n  unite(traj_id, vowel, formant, remove = FALSE) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(percent, hz, color = vowel)) +\n  geom_textpath(aes(group = traj_id, label = vowel), vjust = -0.1, hjust = 0.3) + \n  scale_y_log10() + \n  facet_wrap(~formant, nrow = 1, scales = \"free\") + \n  theme_joey() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt's not bad. With the help of color to help tell the lines apart, I think it does a pretty good job to be honest. Although, I'll mention that I tried this plot out with a couple different aspect ratios, and taller ones work better.\n\n\n\n## Ellipses?\n\n`geomtextpath` has a few other functions, including `geom_textdensity`, `geom_textsmooth`, `geom_textcontour`, `geom_textdensity2d`, which correspond to adding labels to density plots (`geom_density`), 2D density plots (`geom_textdensity2d`), smooths (`stat_smooth`), and contour plots (`geom_contour`). What I would love to see is a function that correspoinds to `stat_ellipse`. I often make plots like this where I add dots and ellipses in the same plot and then add labels at vowel averages with a separate data frame:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmidpoints_means <- midpoints %>%\n  group_by(vowel) %>%\n  summarize(across(c(F1, F2), mean))\nggplot(midpoints, aes(F2, F1, color = vowel)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) + \n  stat_ellipse(level = 0.67) + \n  geom_text(data = midpoints_means, aes(label = vowel)) + \n  scale_x_reverse() + \n  scale_y_reverse() + \n  theme_joey() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt would be pretty cool to see these ellipses get the labels on them rather than plotting at the centers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThat's all. I just wanted to try something new. Maybe this might be useful to you as you plot your vowel trajectory data.",
